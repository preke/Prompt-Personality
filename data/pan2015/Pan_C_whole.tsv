Sudan, Uganda, Cambodia. (genocides) Yang Xinhai, Ramadan Mansour, Luis Garavito. (mass murderers)|||@username Doesn't matter much. Plenty of them support it. Current 'alpha males' didn't start patriarchy either.|||@username @username @username It's not about the money. It's about promising 1 video a month and only delivering 4 vids in 2 years.|||No, PC Advisor. Inkjet printers do NOT fall under the category of color laser printers...   no, @username. Anything that has a sticker saying ""Xerox"" is not an HP Officejet. Nor is the 8100 a laser printer.   I'm really saddened that you have macro photos of tablet screens, test photos on phones, but no sample scans for printers.|||@username He has a tiny point but misses the parts where reviews drive purchases, and where letsplays are transformative in nature.|||I really quite like it that Red Bull will just up and fund stuff like Danny MacAskill's Imaginate:   via @username|||@username @username Availability of old/obscure/quirky/bad games is not a bad thing. The prominence and promotion of those games is.|||It sucks when your phone suddenly won't read a simcard any more. It sucks even more when your PC breaks while looking for a solution. =(|||@username Hurray for Dutch sportsball, huh?|||@username I was on @username and noticed all the 3d models work just fine on my Nexus 7. *thumbs up* for crossplatform functionality!|||The current @username bundle is worth it just for @username 's fantastic Pineapple Smash Crew.|||Today, fear soaked fabric as over 50 victims suffered a gruesome fate. My wardrobe shrunk from 100cm to only 57cm. (1/3)|||Among the casualties are 6 tops, 18 tees, 10 longsleeves, 8 dress shirts, 5 pants, 6 shorts and a suit. (2/3)|||Just saw fireworks in the #netherlands , wondering if it's for #fifaworldcup #BRAvsCOL or some U.S. expats celebrating #IndependenceDay|||@username Man, what a waste of a tweet, talking about responses you don't like... You could have spent it on making a ""WTF is?"" video ;)|||@username But today is not that day!!   because its spelled ""Götze"" and 'oe' is the internationally accepted spelling when you don't have access to diacritics.|||@username is this in response to the recent gamasutra article / FTC quote?|||Bought a new PC with Windows 8.1 hoping it wouldn't be so bad now with the updates. After a day I'm on the verge of a mental breakdown... =(|||Seriously. Who had the idea to replace the standard calculator by a full screen app? I don't need 1920x1200 to multiply some numbers.|||@username @username Instead you want these. Chocolate/marzipan/sugarsprinkles. Don't know the English name.   Yeah I've been looking into similar things, like the stuff from @username. Not sure what I end up choosing yet.|||@username Also, W8.1 apparently has regular calc, but also an appified version (as default) for added confusion and frustration.*sigh*|||@username Definitely gonna give it a try. Seems to be the most feature rich one, and I love the price of free.|||@username Right now? I don't really know. There's no way to disable the metro bit (outside of 3rd party (cont)   Pix or it didn't happen. (Or linx)|||@username Maybe they're taking the adage ""all publicity is good publicity"" a tad too literal?|||@username @username Heh. I like how they call Forbes 'unprofessional'. It's only a century old business magazine, after all.|||Well, #Dota2TI4 championship final was a bit of a letdown... Very one-sided, almost like the Brazil  #FIFA2014 matches earlier this month.|||@username How come NL/EU prices for businesses are so skewed? I almost understand $140 -> €140 But there's no way $400 should -> €540($727)|||Statistics! Colors! Games! Graphs! Numbers! Info! Money! Jerbs! Exclamation Marks!   #gamedev|||@username Ooh. Freddie Mercury! I loved his music in Neverending Story as well. But why is that Spiderman quote in there?|||@username Your bundle currently costs. ?€ I thought that was funny.|||@username Remember when you mentioned RU-UA-EU war? It's already happening on kickstarter, according to Areal!   is a good looking kickstarter!   Love the vid and the header gifs. (oh and the game itself looks interesting too)|||I wouldn't hurt the proverbial fly, but those damn mosquitos... Just killed at least two dozen of the bitey fuckers.|||@username With you being you, I'm not sure if that's ASAP or never.|||How come art software always has such a shitty GUI? I'd assume that designers would understand/appreciate usability.|||@username Will this work with the regular PC forum accounts or do we have to make new ones? Would be handy to have that integrated.|||@username Gotta be honest here, these sprites feel kind of blurry and lacking detail. A downside of 3d, or maybe a render/filter issue?|||@username Can hardly wait for PC version X. What I've gathered there are a bunch of small visual tweaks and a lot of under-the-hood work.|||@username Yeah I know they're 2x. I scaled the image down to 50% first to check my gut. Does ingame have normals or something?|||@username I just finished my last game for the day, this should be a nice way to unwind.|||@username @username It really depends on the quality of the stuff, much like chocolate. Often I find they add too much powder, too.|||I... Uh... what? Dafuq?
  Don't worry. You will be surgeried by only the most pro of fessionals.   How are the podcasts rubbish? Only thing edited for (the YT version of) that are the commercials, right?|||@username I get the removal of streamed 'regular' music, I do. But background music from games? And beyond that, do you think that (1/2)|||@username it should apply to games in general? (textures+models+etc=©, too) You generally say that streaming is a transformative art.|||@username Technically, this is a mobile game. And I'm not sure I would call this 'playing'.|||Yup, salticidae are definitely the bestest, coolest and most awesomest spiders.

  No. You'd be wasting far too much time debugging variables, when such a simple command is all you need.|||@username Ooh. Sanchez. I strongly approve of this.|||@username @username @username I'm in that camp. Everyone* has a smartphone now, which makes it a true -personal- computer.|||@username @username The biggest problem with round robin is a lack of focus. Sports thrive on spectators. (semi)Finals get more views.|||@username @username Says it right there ""? The Jester Race
A song by In Flames""|||@username @username Given that you regularly do long takes, though, this one felt ""slighly off"". (j/k well done Zooc)|||@username Lamb allergy is a pretty lame allergy.|||@username I think you're mixing up Gone Home and Dear Esther. Not many people argued Gone Home wasn't a game, just not a GOOD one.|||@username I think you should do a combination. Good projects deserve love, but also one/sporadic supercut of bad to keep people warned.|||@username It might work to have a few bad trailers at the start of each vid? Nope, nope, nope, this looks decent.|||@username @username @username Hurrah! You didn't call it the A/S/L challenge. +1 for knowing the actual charity's name.|||@username @username Heck, look at people lighting up torches and pitchforks after spending just a few hundred dollars on a gaming box...|||@username AND DOLLA DOLLA BILLS YO. (also my shirt)|||@username @username   seems kind of relevant in this case too. From several perspectives.|||@username You're right on the first account. Many would argue about the 2nd; the nature of  debates is divisive.   What's the crest for that?|||@username That actually seems interesting data, yeah. I wonder if there's some kind of metrics script for that.|||Using your phone can be dangerous even if you're not driving. Sorry mr snail...|||@username Liking youtubers isn't a problem either. Which leaves ""harassing"" as the only issue.|||@username Threat? Or... treat?|||Simple yet clear marking of gluten/lactose/vegetarian/etc foods. Good on you, Germany.   I know, right. You're actually complain about framerates and texture quality most of the time.|||@username For me, personally, it's like a TV show. I can relax to it because it's more passive than articles, yet is not supershort.|||@username @username Quite an innovative new 'exclusive' system; just exclude yourself from a lot of games.Wonder where this will go?|||@username @username You mean ""asshole"" culture, within the gaming and internet audience, right? I'm pretty sure that's what you mean.|||@username @username @username Should the flooding work that way? Don't you need 2 holes; one for water in, one for air out?|||@username Dual monocles and tophat for maximum gentlemanliness.|||@username Jim, try Monster Rehab.

Personally, I just wait for price drops.|||@username @username And what if it gets voided before you managed to install/play?|||@username @username It was a hypothetical. Hence why he says ""at your own risk"". It might work fine, it might cost you.|||@username Definitely think that you do 3 can stop early. A game has max 20 minutes, if it impresses you sooner, good on it.|||@username @username Ooh, this is pretty. Any info on how it's done? Looks like uprezzed render, sure, but any special texture approach?|||@username What, you're able to not hate someone you disagree with? Is this some kind of magic? Are you a wizerds?|||@username @username It is rather uncanny...   binge-read the entirety of @username's comic. It's gooood.   @username With 300+ employees, they're well past the 'Dunbar number'; a group of ~150 is what our human brains can manage.|||Didn't know I, a European, could send emails about net neutrality to US Gov. EUROPEANS UNITE!     I've always likened Dear Esther to a book or movie. You can press play/pause, but you don't really have any agency.|||@username Personally, I'd love physical media as an option, if it were JUST that. But most games nowadays are just a DVD + steam code.|||@username Next bundle?   you have your own NPC and you're giving out games?

Even then, the movies were about complex interpersonal things, not just 'meek' vs 'strong'.|||@username And that has been represented (though lacking inter-faction things) by the nemesis system.|||@username @username No, thanks. I'd rather have TB's face on camera instead of the other end.|||@username This is largely due to you being (afaik) honest and open and (to a degree) personal. Same goes for TB. Just keep doing that.|||@username What's the difference between your $40 cable and this $10 cable, aside from the plastic/fabric cover?   Hey, more spammers!

He's talked about gender issues several times in the past.|||@username @username And not everything needs a deep story to be a great game. Tetris, Doom, Pacman, etcetera.|||@username @username Our point is that a preference for 1080p, story, or genre, or AAA or indie, a preference won't ""destroy gaming"".|||@username That's elitist and ungrounded. He probably understands issues, but disagrees on the degree of which things need fixing.|||@username It's similar to the debate about affirmative action, which in itself is discriminatory and unrepresentative of society.|||Upgraded my PC a bit. It now streams music and internet at 45 watts. Forty. Five. My PC is a lightbulb. It's fricken awesome.|||@username Hey I just bought a 750 Ti SC and was wondering, did the RotT offer expire or did I overlook something in the box?|||@username I know you're not a review guy, but this is right up your alley.

It's a rather nasty tactic.|||@username in the sense of you putting together the bundles for sale, the term would be curator. You curate the collection/inventory.|||@username @username That's not what he says. He says go to cops, go to people that can do shit, but don't give harassers a podium.|||@username @username That's nonsense. When someone says they're Muslim or feminist, you don't associate them with 9/11 or Valerie Solanas.|||@username @username So why is #Gamersgate judged by its worst instead of by their best or by their average or on a individual basis?|||@username How would I be enabling them? Do asshats need me in order to be asshats? No. They try to hijack GG, so stop validating them.|||@username To harass a person that was corrupting. Not saying harassing her is okay, just saying it wasn't an attack on women in general.|||@username There have been fuckups by asshole, which should have been addressed. But instead, media have turned against gamers as a WHOLE.|||@username NONE were justified. You will not hear me say any of them 'deserve' threats or doxxing. Heavy criciticism, yes. Harassment, no.|||@username It's perfectly possible to tackle several issues at once. Aside that, I don't harass people, so I'm not living in a glass house.|||@username No offense taken. Just wanna make clear from that if I talk #gamergate, I'm still #antiharassment. Because it IS an issue.|||@username Ran into the 140 character limit there, so I slightly changed phrasing. Yes, you're right; it happens - but it shouldn't.|||@username They're saying bullying is like (similar, not the same) in that it's largely a cyclical problem.|||@username Not really. GG isn't about removing feminism from games (critique). It's about transparency of biases (relations, politics).|||@username In fact,Vivian James is quite feminist; a decently rounded female character supporting a game designed by women.|||@username @username @username @username It's a screenshot from the linked article.   It DOES matter. SOME feminists, SOME religious people are psycho, SOME gamers are psycho. SOME <insert group here> are psycho.|||@username The article in fact clarifies that it's a extremist faction. It doesn't indict the GG movement, but separates GG / harrassers.|||@username How serious are you about making games? There could be a way to work in a ""few bad apples"" mechanic regarding GG&harassment.|||@username @username Did a quick google. Doesn't look like many people support this 'operation'.

Granted, she wasn't a man, but oh the irony of feminists harassing women...|||@username @username Guys, guys. Calm down. Think of a cyanic turquoise.|||@username I know. But don't give up feminism just because a few feminists drove Erin Pizzey from her job. The majority aren't like that.|||@username @username I gotta say, that entire account feels fake. Looks like a very obvious double-doublecross.|||@username No I mean she's a faked anti-GG.   It's bad satire, or to rile up people against anti-GG people.|||@username Hey I've got a weird bug. I got an email to confirm a new connection, but when I log in it tells me my email isn't recognized?|||@username Gotta say, it's quite sexist to tell women they have no power.|||@username Hmm... oh! Because power is not evenly spread throughout a gender, so some women have more power than men, and can be sexist?|||@username Well I tried that duplicate account link. I now indeed have two accounts =P But I can only log in to the new one. Deleting it.|||@username Derp. Figured it out. I hailed Mary, typed my Gmail address, logged in to primary account.

Though, why do some of the arrows 'float'?|||@username They""refuse to give oxygen to a disturbing minority"" who ""harass, bully, or intimidate"" ... not #gamergate as a whole.|||@username Why should I donate to people I disagree with? How would it help against harassment? I'll just report harassment to twitter, ok?|||@username Who claims ignorance? GG people are reporting on & distantiating from the harassers. Analogy: If you support Islam after 9/11.|||@username @username  This is a job for... GAEMS JURNELIZM!   I feel this lacks a keyboard and mouse. =(|||@username @username He used it twice in the past week, and once in this URL that he cannot change except for the 'johnbain' at the end.|||@username Not quite.

But next time, maybe use unscaled shots, or at least the same scaling ratio for both snippets?|||@username Not anymore they don't.   'Surprisingly' their about page is currently missing the partners list.|||@username @username It's plausible, not 100% checkable. Mercedes used to advertise, but gawker hid the ad-partners list recently.|||@username I'm not entirely sure we should. Companies pressuring media is a risk, they could enforce better reviews etc. ""Jeff Gerstmann""|||@username True, which is why I'm on the fence. Secondary issue: this hits more than just Sam. Then again, several coworkers act similar.|||@username Frankly, I'd rather see a change in attitude, open conversation instead of only covering the harassment, than see people fired.|||@username Because these tweets are, in the grand scheme of thing, less important than the radio silence regarding transparency.|||@username You asked how Gawker relates to game journalism; it owns a game journalism site. I answered exactly what you asked.|||@username @username Gawker is relevant because it owns Kotaku, and thus bears responsibility for it. Deadspin doesn't own Kotaku.|||@username @username And the sad part is, Deadspin actually did cover GG ethics, and in a more balanced way.   You mean Jeff Gerstmann? No, the corrupt ones would be the people that fired him for giving 'too low' scores.|||@username @username Not if it's relevant. A review may be personal, as long as it's transparent.|||@username Dropping it now isn't good. The media only responded to the bad side; harassment. They need to talk about transparency & COI.|||@username @username Sure. But we can choose who we read. We learn how a site/writer thinks and use that as a reference point.|||@username E.g. Totalbiscuit often says he doesn't like platformers, so when he likes one, that's notable. Same goes for other aspects."	0

88	"@username All of this should be discussed with the media, as a secondary point. Most important now are transparency, ethics and COI.|||@username @username @username  Retweeted, reported.|||@username The ethics point about bayonetta isn't quiiite true.           Did you only read the reddit OP? OP is for the 'operation'. majority of comments and both other links shoot him down.|||@username One guy (+ yes a few supporters) versus a lot of opponents. Polygon says ""gamergate wants us to do this"" It's very misleading.|||@username ... damn. I gotta process this for a bit.|||@username You have the right to complain. But this is advocating that publishers have power over scores. That's shilling. It's corrupt.|||@username @username It is not reasonable. Publishers influencing game scores by withdrawing ad money is HUGELY damaging to journalism.|||@username Dude you have made HUGE mistake promoting 'operation bayonetta'. Changing review scores because of publisher pressure is corrupt.|||@username @username Good thing she was already kicked from twitter about a week ago then, huh?|||@username hate speech?|||@username you consider ""i think this game is sexist"" to be hate speech?|||@username @username Eh, I don't think the bayonetta review is 'hate speech'.   Not really. It says that the sexualization is gratuitous and meaningless. It doesn't say you're horrible for liking that.|||@username I'm a bigot because I disagree? Seriously, grab a dictionary and look up ""bigot"", ""hate speech"" ""corruption"" and ""coercion"".|||@username Saying ""I think this uses needless amounts of sexualization"" is not hate speech.|||@username This isn't gender/sex shaming. It's saying the reviewer doesn't like something. It doesn't judge YOU for liking tits and ass.|||@username Good to hear your voice again, and know you're playing games again. Makes me happy that you're getting on your feet. =)|||@username Or, it's because PC gamers' persona. You can't develop games on an Xbox or a phone. PC games have mods. PG gamers are ENGAGED.|||@username How about you interview some every-day-muslims instead of ISIL? I.E. people that support gamersgate but aren't harrassholes?|||This awesome project is still around! Get smarter and feed people @username school meals   via @username|||@username @username   ""Nowhere on my site does it say we are journalists"". Oh? #GamerGate   Hey, can we have a calm & rational discussion without calling names? Why exactly do you feel the Bayonetta review is hate speech?|||@username Tags alone don't mean much, anyway. #gamergate #feminism #isis #USpresident #shoes see? Look at the whole person, not a tag.|||@username I'll send comforting words, but I won't finance their projects because I simply don't agree with them.That makes sense, right?|||@username Reported for spam.|||@username I'm sorry for you. I'm sorry that someone damaged you so much that you now want to see others hurt in the same way.|||@username @username Sober is good. Relaxation is good. Being alive is good, even if it might not always feel that way.|||@username @username @username @username @username Don't be an asshole, okay?|||@username @username @username Can you show me? I don't like people harassing anyone. I assume you've already reported twitter?|||@username The bravest thing a muslim can do right this moment is to leave the religion. Because ISIS. Yeah, that rethoric doesn't fly.|||@username Decrying an entire group for the actions of a minority isn't the correct way to go. Weed out the harassers, not the whole.|||@username Is the harasser banned/removed yet?|||@username So link me there, so I can report. You're making it kind of hard for me to condemn harassment this way. Or rather, to act.|||@username I'd hardly consider that a bannable offense though. But yeah I'll see if I can calm some people down.|||@username Dude just stop it. It's not worth the effort because this guy will get offended by pretty much anything. Just ignore him.|||@username I assume by now you doun they consider pretty much vulgarity a slur and it's no use bothering. If not, well, now you have.|||@username You know what, I give up. I tried to be supremely soft, but even that apparently won't do.|||@username I hereby condemn harassment. Please do not contact me anymore.|||@username @username @username I hereby condemn all harassments. I feel we should report them, particularly ones about death.|||@username @username @username Here are some egregious ones that hurt me a lot, insulting me as a gamer.   @username @username Can we please report this @username account for harassment insults and triggering?|||@username @username @username That does not give him the right to harass all those who didn't. I haven't, yet I am now hurt.|||@username @username @username You are the one that started messaging them again, despite them clearly not wanting that.|||@username @username @username I feel like I now also have to report you for spam, unless you stop contacting us from now on.|||@username will not ask again. Stop contacting us. In return I will not contact you.|||@username REMOVE ME FROM YOUR MESSAGES AND DO NOT CONTACT OR MENTION ME AGAIN.|||@username Also don't retweet me. I do not want any more interaction with you whatsoever. This is not a question.|||@username @username @username Well that's not true.   @username   Comments? Poef! Weg comments.|||@username Was it this thread? A Case Study in youtube promotion and paid promotion disclamer.   Vandaar: ""Edit:
Regarding deletion: The official reason the admin gave me was that it was a fuckup and they reapproved it now.""|||@username @username @username @username  Gamergate makes such a big deal? She's been on NYT, MSNBC, NPR,   @username @username @username Yet gamergate is the one inserting her into the discussion, instead of the media corps?|||@username @username You mean, directly having a financial tie with the people you report on?|||@username @username ""British gamer who disagrees with feminist critiques of gaming culture, argues on her blog"" - aangehaald als expert?|||@username @username ""Cathy Young writes a weekly column"" - een nieuwsartikel?|||@username @username Enjoy: @username JennyOHenry cosmicglider 3lewd5me TechyFolks twilightpheonix|||@username @username Grass is one of the most essential foilages. It worked wonders in things like TrackMania.   And Charles Manson was a vegan. Go figure. Volkert van der Graaf as well. Also Hitler! Clearly these vegans are a bad group.|||Dutch newsshow paints GG as a hate group, uses conflicting footage. Take note, be calm, please give them a day to respond cuz office hours.|||@username Then tomorrow, contact them and calmly explain why you disagree. #gamergate #equality #fairness   Reported, retweeted.|||@username The media reject discourse and keep painting all of gamergate as a hategroup. They tell us to drop the hashtag, because it 1/?|||@username is tainted. GG are actively fighting that minority, because they feel the #gamergate hashtag is worth cleaning.|||@username If the media so desperately want us to switch hashtags, let them create a clean one,  with traction, and move the discussion.|||@username Notice how the only one of those screenshots with the hashtag attached to it, very quickly got a bunch of reports?|||@username The absurd thing is they're not supporting gamergate. They're just against Gawker. ""The enemy of my enemy"" doesn't always apply.|||@username @username No; revolt was based on anger at a dev sleeping with a journalist, a PR person, a boss and an award judge.|||@username Read them. I agree with you on many points. However I think that a distinction between those who want ethics and those who|||@username hide behind 'ethics' is definitely one that should be made. From the start there was this division, and yes, the hashtag is|||@username tainted to a degree. But like Muslims/ISIL, Christians/KKK, I feel it's unwarranted to ask people to drop the GG hashtag.|||@username If anything, journalists should start their own 'fresh' tag with a decent amount of traction, if they want people to switch|||@username Don't do this. Contacting advertisers over bullying is a bit of a grey area but you decide. However this is unethical because|||@username there are conflicting interests. You're promoting a publisher to financially pressure a higher score.|||@username That is an arguable point, but even if we would agree, the methods you use are unethical. The end doesn't justify these means.|||@username Personally, scores as a precise number are bullshit, because reviews are very personal, and should serve as an anchoring point|||@username I know. I disagreed then as well.   I disagree; a reviewer may have biases as long as they're transparent and obvious. And we may criticize them for that.|||@username but we may not try to force their opinions away.|||@username No it's an attempt at reasoning with you. I'm not preventing you from doing this, I'm saying that what you're doing is|||@username promoting developers to force a re-review on one of their games, which would be coercion and would ruin journalistic isolation|||@username Everthing is seen through a personal lens, though. What makes a story good? What is good gameplay? Fast? Slow?|||@username An impartial-as-possible review would be nothing more than listing mechanics/bugs, and reiterating box quotes.|||@username Do you think TotalBiscuit is a good revie- *cough* first-impressioner?|||@username @username Because he acts more along SJP ethics than many 'game journalist' blogs. Yet his opinions are strongly personal.|||@username @username Example:   The intro makes it VERY clear he doesn't generally like puzzlers or platformers.|||@username Which is a bias. But because he's frank about it, I can take those biases in to account, if I myself do or don't like them.|||@username It's 9:01 here and I'm still awake. Give me a few minutes.|||@username @username Our core disagreement is about the inclusion of personal opinion and biases, correct?|||@username I have to go to work in 20.|||@username @username Shush. That's insulting and adds nothing to the discussion.|||@username @username I've reported several doxxers when I could. They are now banned. Is that a specific enough denouncement?|||@username @username I generally don""t demounce an perob completery, rather specific actions. Example: operatio bayonetta|||@username @username I believe we should focus on bad behavior, not people. Everybody makes mistakes. Some are stupid, some are vile.|||@username @username I denounce those that are actively inflicting harm, I try to esucate those who are dumb or ununformed.|||@username @username those two accounts I mentioned had only negatives. They're gone now.|||@username @username gotta work again now. Sorry for all spelling errors. On a phone and correcting takes too long =P|||@username Well he's not wrong. Sexism is treating someone a particular way because of gender. It doesn't necessarily have to be hate.|||@username For example holding open doors for women but not men. It's sexist, it's stupid, but I'd hardly call it hateful behavior."	0
