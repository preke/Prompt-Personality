Atari's Rollercoaster Tycoon games don't even -have- a demo. I'd rather have 30 free poops than no toilet at all. Just saying...  You somewhere else now, or stepped out? Tell me it's not because of the current/recent shitstorm? Random question: are there any plans for an escapist html videoplayer? I can't watch the JQ on my phone because of flash. very American model though; spend money first hoping you can pay off debts later. Just like a giant credit card.Seriously, DOTA. I leave the game because one guy buys a billion couriers, another guy suicides them, and you send me to low priority? Did I see this right? Did you put someone with vitiligo in the latest vid? Nice. Sock, sock, shoe, shoe, tie, hat, boxershorts?RIP my shoe. :(   Well look at it from his perspective. When have you had a successful multi-person podcast before? Aside from WoW, TCOP, TGS...Quite liking the style of this series.   Have you heard of the 'new' Nvidia DSR anti-aliasing? Isn't it absurd to go back to oldschool subsampling versus cheap algos?""Netflix, can I see Enemy at the Gates?""  ""No, but I can show you Top Gear, Mythbusters or District 9"" netflixrecommendations It's not a LotR game per the title. Even then, the movies were about complex interpersonal things, not just 'meek' vs 'strong'. And that has been represented (though lacking inter-faction things) by the nemesis system.  No, thanks. I'd rather have TB's face on camera instead of the other end. This is largely due to you being (afaik) honest and open and (to a degree) personal. Same goes for TB. Just keep doing that. What's the difference between your $40 cable and this $10 cable, aside from the plastic/fabric cover?   Hey, more spammers!   Sure but if you're going to fix shit, you're spending money, and if you spend money, you're negating that tasty DoubleDipDough™  Oh no, looks like BF4 had some big launch issues. Just like BF3. But BF5 won't! We promise...     I hope you play games for the gameplay not for the story. People like you are destroying gaming. /s  To be fair, Apple users need cloud-protection the most right now. Not an ad for Apple, but a motivation to try Dropbox?  Disregard? You mean 'different opinion'. He's talked about gender issues several times in the past.  And not everything needs a deep story to be a great game. Tetris, Doom, Pacman, etcetera.  Our point is that a preference for 1080p, story, or genre, or AAA or indie, a preference won't ""destroy gaming"". That's elitist and ungrounded. He probably understands issues, but disagrees on the degree of which things need fixing. It's similar to the debate about affirmative action, which in itself is discriminatory and unrepresentative of society."	0
"Upgraded my PC a bit. It now streams music and internet at 45 watts. Forty. Five. My PC is a lightbulb. It's fricken awesome. Hey I just bought a 750 Ti SC and was wondering, did the RotT offer expire or did I overlook something in the box? I know you're not a review guy, but this is right up your alley. A review -exclusively- about textures.    This seems an interesting feature. Will you only review the quality of textures, or also explore workflows/methods? ""document"". To find out a persons real name, address and as much info about them, put it in a file and make it publicly available. It's to get as much mud to sling online as well as to scare people IRL. It's a rather nasty tactic. in the sense of you putting together the bundles for sale, the term would be curator. You curate the collection/inventory.  That's not what he says. He says go to cops, go to people that can do shit, but don't give harassers a podium.  That's nonsense. When someone says they're Muslim or feminist, you don't associate them with 9/11 or Valerie Solanas.  So why is Gamersgate judged by its worst instead of by their best or by their average or on a individual basis? How would I be enabling them? Do asshats need me in order to be asshats? No. They try to hijack GG, so stop validating them. To harass a person that was corrupting. Not saying harassing her is okay, just saying it wasn't an attack on women in general. There have been fuckups by asshole, which should have been addressed. But instead, media have turned against gamers as a WHOLE. NONE were justified. You will not hear me say any of them 'deserve' threats or doxxing. Heavy criciticism, yes. Harassment, no. It's perfectly possible to tackle several issues at once. Aside that, I don't harass people, so I'm not living in a glass house. No offense taken. Just wanna make clear from that if I talk gamergate, I'm still antiharassment. Because it IS an issue. Ran into the 140 character limit there, so I slightly changed phrasing. Yes, you're right; it happens - but it shouldn't. They're saying bullying is like (similar, not the same) in that it's largely a cyclical problem. Not really. GG isn't about removing feminism from games (critique). It's about transparency of biases (relations, politics). In fact,Vivian James is quite feminist; a decently rounded female character supporting a game designed by women.    It's a screenshot from the linked article.   It DOES matter. SOME feminists, SOME religious people are psycho, SOME gamers are psycho. SOME <insert group here> are psycho. The article in fact clarifies that it's a extremist faction. It doesn't indict the GG movement, but separates GG / harrassers. How serious are you about making games? There could be a way to work in a ""few bad apples"" mechanic regarding GG&harassment.  Did a quick google. Doesn't look like many people support this 'operation'.    "	0
" Hey did you find an artist for Ladra yet? I just saw the thread on . Reported, retweeted.  Is it that hard to figure out? A link to multiple accounts harassing Anita. Several GGers reported them. You?  I'm calling out violent extremists that supposedly are 'with me'. You 'oppose them' but don't call them out?  Sorry? Is this a competition or something? A sport? I thought we were talking about people harassing people?  Look at my feed, count how many times I've used the hashtag (hint: once). Now look at your own feed. Count.  I align with the morals of the majority who want transparency. I don't align with the harassment cabal. Valerie Solanas, Erin Pizzey, KillAllMen, ironic misandry. Don't worry. MOST feminists aren't like that. Just a small.. cabal. I won't ask you to give up feminism. In return, don't tell me I should give up my own values because of a minority, okay? Hey, I'm not sure if you want to keep this name. 'Doxx' and 'doxxing' are bad things living in dark parts of the internet. ""Don't Engage"" doesn't mean ""don't tell the cops, don't report to twitter"", just ""don't give them direct attention"". Feminists drove Erin Pizzey out of the country. Granted, she wasn't a man, but oh the irony of feminists harassing women...  Guys, guys. Calm down. Think of a cyanic turquoise. I know. But don't give up feminism just because a few feminists drove Erin Pizzey from her job. The majority aren't like that.  I gotta say, that entire account feels fake. Looks like a very obvious double-doublecross. No I mean she's a faked anti-GG.   It's bad satire, or to rile up people against anti-GG people. Hey I've got a weird bug. I got an email to confirm a new connection, but when I log in it tells me my email isn't recognized? Gotta say, it's quite sexist to tell women they have no power. Hmm... oh! Because power is not evenly spread throughout a gender, so some women have more power than men, and can be sexist? Well I tried that duplicate account link. I now indeed have two accounts =P But I can only log in to the new one. Deleting it. Derp. Figured it out. I hailed Mary, typed my Gmail address, logged in to primary account. Received the invitation via Hotmail So I figure they used my old contact info. Thanks for helping me narrow this down, anyway.Well this is an appropriate glitch. A video about being in in a quantum state... being in a quantum state.    This... this is a pretty decent high-level abstraction of everything. Well done, diagrammer. Though, why do some of the arrows 'float'? They""refuse to give oxygen to a disturbing minority"" who ""harass, bully, or intimidate"" ... not gamergate as a whole. Why should I donate to people I disagree with? How would it help against harassment? I'll just report harassment to twitter, ok?"	0
" Who claims ignorance? GG people are reporting on & distantiating from the harassers. Analogy: If you support Islam after 9/11.   This is a job for... GAEMS JURNELIZM!   I feel this lacks a keyboard and mouse. =(  He used it twice in the past week, and once in this URL that he cannot change except for the 'johnbain' at the end. Not quite. The top two are the same, but the bottomright one is 3f013c instead of 31013c. Sorry. It looked like the f had no terminal, but after matching x-placements it seems an f indeed.   But next time, maybe use unscaled shots, or at least the same scaling ratio for both snippets? Not anymore they don't.   'Surprisingly' their about page is currently missing the partners list.  It's plausible, not 100% checkable. Mercedes used to advertise, but gawker hid the ad-partners list recently. I'm not entirely sure we should. Companies pressuring media is a risk, they could enforce better reviews etc. ""Jeff Gerstmann"" True, which is why I'm on the fence. Secondary issue: this hits more than just Sam. Then again, several coworkers act similar. Frankly, I'd rather see a change in attitude, open conversation instead of only covering the harassment, than see people fired. Because these tweets are, in the grand scheme of thing, less important than the radio silence regarding transparency. You asked how Gawker relates to game journalism; it owns a game journalism site. I answered exactly what you asked.  Gawker is relevant because it owns Kotaku, and thus bears responsibility for it. Deadspin doesn't own Kotaku.  And the sad part is, Deadspin actually did cover GG ethics, and in a more balanced way.   You mean Jeff Gerstmann? No, the corrupt ones would be the people that fired him for giving 'too low' scores.  Not if it's relevant. A review may be personal, as long as it's transparent. Dropping it now isn't good. The media only responded to the bad side; harassment. They need to talk about transparency & COI.  Sure. But we can choose who we read. We learn how a site/writer thinks and use that as a reference point. E.g. Totalbiscuit often says he doesn't like platformers, so when he likes one, that's notable. Same goes for other aspects."	0
" does Heroes of the Storm count?E3 + following some game people = one bajillion tweets per second. bringing new meaning to the term ""board member""  Because wool things are more volumetric, and flat/spiky things like leaves/teeth (and road) look better as felt. Cause you're uninformed? Sudan, Uganda, Cambodia. (genocides) Yang Xinhai, Ramadan Mansour, Luis Garavito. (mass murderers) Doesn't matter much. Plenty of them support it. Current 'alpha males' didn't start patriarchy either.   It's not about the money. It's about promising 1 video a month and only delivering 4 vids in 2 years.No, PC Advisor. Inkjet printers do NOT fall under the category of color laser printers...   no, . Anything that has a sticker saying ""Xerox"" is not an HP Officejet. Nor is the 8100 a laser printer.   I'm really saddened that you have macro photos of tablet screens, test photos on phones, but no sample scans for printers. He has a tiny point but misses the parts where reviews drive purchases, and where letsplays are transformative in nature.I really quite like it that Red Bull will just up and fund stuff like Danny MacAskill's Imaginate:   via   Availability of old/obscure/quirky/bad games is not a bad thing.

With you being you, I'm not sure if that's ASAP or never.How come art software always has such a shitty GUI? I'd assume that designers would understand/appreciate usability. Will this work with the regular PC forum accounts or do we have to make new ones? Would be handy to have that integrated. Gotta be honest here, these sprites feel kind of blurry and lacking detail. A downside of 3d, or maybe a render/filter issue? Can hardly wait for PC version X. What I've gathered there are a bunch of small visual tweaks and a lot of under-the-hood work. Yeah I know they're 2x. I scaled the image down to 50% first to check my gut. Does ingame have normals or something? I just finished my last game for the day, this should be a nice way to unwind.

And I'm not sure I would call this 'playing'.Yup, salticidae are definitely the bestest, coolest and most awesomest spiders.

"   I'm in that camp. Everyone* has a smartphone now, which makes it a true -personal- computer.  The biggest problem with round robin is a lack of focus. Sports thrive on spectators.

(j/k well done Zooc) Lamb allergy is a pretty lame allergy. I think you're mixing up Gone Home and Dear Esther. Not many people argued Gone Home wasn't a game, just not a GOOD one. I think you should do a combination. Good projects deserve love, but also one/sporadic supercut of bad to keep people warned. It might work to have a few bad trailers at the start of each vid? Nope, nope, nope, this looks decent.   Hurrah! You didn't call it the A/S/L challenge. +1 for knowing the actual charity's name.

Good on you, Germany.   I know, right. You're actually complain about framerates and texture quality most of the time. For me, personally, it's like a TV show.

You mean ""asshole"" culture, within the gaming and internet audience, right? I'm pretty sure that's what you mean.   Should the flooding work that way? Don't you need 2 holes; one for water in, one for air out? Dual monocles and tophat for maximum gentlemanliness. Jim, try Monster Rehab. It's not nearly as sugary as regular (about 25%) but it doesn't taste like deat-... I mean sweeteners.  Unless your licence gets voided, in which case you pay €35 AND €70. Personally, I just wait for price drops.  And what if it gets voided before you managed to install/play?  It was a hypothetical. Hence why he says ""at your own risk"". It might work fine, it might cost you. Definitely think that you do 3 can stop early. A game has max 20 minutes, if it impresses you sooner, good on it.  Ooh, this is pretty.

"My day consists of school,twitter,Instagram, tumblr, food, music and sleep.And I wonder why I don't have a lifeLiving on an island with very small minded people who tend to piss me off doesn't help.Monday I will start running and training for next year I thinkNot sure if I should get up at 5 and go for a walk/run or wait until after school tomorrow... help newfittieI literally hate my body. That's why I have decided to change it.I have 3 dogs: small, medium, large, all black with a little white bit on their chest. It's like I have the three evolutions of a PokemonSometimes I think ""yeah, I'm gonna ace today!"" And then ""Fuck you, fuck him, fuck her and fuck the world. I'm going back to bed""I don't bother watching the news it just depresses me.It's always the cat got run over, never the cat was saved from falling out of a tree by a nice man walking home from workI'm kaput so I'm off to bed night night xIt's a shame I can't watch a possession movie without scaring myself so bad I almost have a panic attack.Just got a flat on way home glad someone actually knows what they are doingThis changing of the hour has really fucked up my body clock. I will be waking up at 5 tomorrow. Great.Another day to be awkward at school. Sometimes I wonder why I want to be a hairdresser if every time I talk to someone I have a panic attackGot choc Philly all over my iPhone.Can't wait for the day I can walk into the tattoo shop down in the city and tell them exactly what I want.I will most probably fail this examI feel like I am going to fail this year. My first exam and I only passed by 1 point.Just given my mum a pedicure. Now it's her turn to give me one.Peas in pesto for dinnerI really can't be asked today. Just getting dressed is an effortLooks like I'm going to get caught in a rain storm and I haven't got an umbrellaI wish I didn't have panic attacks whenever I even think of going outOnce of my dogs is scared of storms so now she is following me about the house.So pissed off right nowI wish I was pretty or at least cuteStudying for exams on Thursday and next wee. Why did I want to continue to college and not get a job?   think I'm getting a cold.I really want to clean my room but I really can't be botheredI really do hate myselfAm I alive or just breathing?I hate my body, and I hate the way I think about myselfIve only been up 6 minutes and I cant stop sneezingMy stomach keeps making weird noises and this is so embarassing in publicAt least my makeup has decided to make me look good instead of a 5 year old who's found her mothers lipstickWhy am I always ill for Halloween ? Do ghosts come and make me ill on purpose?"	0
Cause if they do they could stop right about now before the snotty gates are openedI really can't be bothered with life today.Starting the night with Shutter IslandWell shutter island confused the hell outta me last nightNow watching Summer's blood. Still can't decide if it's good or notFor the moment it looks like it's weirdSometimes I don't even know who I amAnother fun filled day *so much sarcasm even Sheldon Cooper notices it*Watching brave with my niece and mother in lawI love my boyf. He does so much for me.Even when I don't deserve anythingTwo days running with waffles for breakfast :)Sometimes I wish I was someone elseEveryone I know has got/going to have their cars bought for them. I only know one person who is buying their own car, and me... I just walk.I want for there to be a really big storm today or tomorrowI just downloaded wanelo and I'm already addicted. I love it!Follow me on Wanelo     won a win the lottery and buy myself a entire wardrobe of new clothes.I think I have changed a lot in the last week. I have realized a lot of things and actually thought about some stuff.I missed my parka so much this summerI hate my body so muchI weighed myself and went through most of my clothes to find I am a small whale and hardly any of my clothes fit me anymore.I even hated myself when I was like 5I shouldn't be left on my own for very long, I start to think about things that I really shouldn't think about for my own mental health. what?My biggest decision today has been to take a bath or not.God I'm boring.I have become one of those people who doesn't mind anything, doesn't have any actual interest in life and doesn't have a favorite anything.I don't want to be like that.This bath shall be dedicated rose aching the net for things I might like. I need interestsGrease lightning, go grease lightning!Why dont I live in America?I don't want longer hair, I need longer hair.I didn't know ordering extensions would be so hardGot my eyebrows done today! Yay!Now dyeing my eyelashesI think I might start doing yoga. Put the old yoga stuff to use at leastThere is a girl in my class that has tattooed her brows on, but in the color she dyes her hair and not her natural color (c)So she has red eyebrows, and now wants to change her hair color to blonde.I am so bored of everyone in my class already. And we have only been at school for two monthsThis is going to be a long yearI have put on so much weight so quickly the scars on my leg has deformed my leg.Wow. I bet that was a lovely image.I want a double bedI can't wait to move in with my boyf, do the weekly shopping, cook him meals, watch films together... I'm 17 going on 30	0
"If someone compliments me and I ""ignore"" it, it's because I think they've been paid to say it or are going to be mean.Like "" you have lovely eyes"" and then once I have said Thanks, they'll say ""shame your so ugly"" or somethingI'd love yo be blonde but I don't trust myself not to mess it up and the hair salon would be way to expensive to get roots done every monthI just realized that in 10 years time most of us will have kids and tweet about them. A lot.I love going clothes shopping but I easily get stressed out if there are more than two people in the shop with meI should make a habit of checkin my back in the mirror at least once before leaving the houseYesterday I had a giant white feather on my back and No one told me until people started making chicken noises at meMy order has shipped! Yaaay ^^My tl comes alive just as I am getting ready for bed :(I am so annoyed my hairdresser cut my fringe wonky. Like, I paid you to cut a straight line and you really couldn't do thatOnce my extensions arrive I will be on my way to the shop to buy dye :DI miss dying my hair funny colors, but my hair will fall out if I bleach it again"	0

" to reply on YOUR opening tweet. In general the urge to self-protect is stronger due to a larger short-term effect of survival.  it is not a X versus Y case. It is a X case with an additional layer of Y.  this shift of balance   was about the fight versus harmony balance you started with. people fight/hurt as part of self focus. survival/dominance whatever you want to call it. and if you want a discussion, you need to provide a better model than I just gave you as an explanation. Otherwise it is not + + a discussion session but a mere teaching/information session. well, then lets conclude you and I have different perceptions of discussions, mine ends here. (for sake of being friends) ;) typical thing the Scottish and the Dutch have in common. I am the exception to the rule though. Very generous. I actually + + need to learn the lesson you provided. :D so, you dress up, undress and dress up again to go to the party? :P  I second that. I think I owe you all some picturs of my favourite forest.  they'll have plenty of content to LOL about. :D    :S are you forgetting you are an Introvert? They can't go to two parties and be thrilled about it?! :S  :P  my world of expectations is slowly falling apart. Oh well. :) Enjoy!   Introverts talkative? Depends on the subject. Ordinary shit: ISTJ's. read     wait! Wut? 2 parties?! All night!?! *mental breakdown, drops on knees praying for reassuring patterns* read how we operate     ANY type can be very talkative, it all depends on the subject at hand. only valid if all risks to life are comets. never apologise for the truth. words can not harm you, only if you chose to. turn to the dark side do not. R.I.P. Here lay the remains of what once was a sensible human being, dearly beloved by his fellow INFJ's Prince. We miss you.Haven't found true love yet? Don't worry...   reality always is... sounds like a trailer to the next episode in the Hannibal Lector series... : please, don't mistake realism with pessimism. do you have a religious belief that your true love will be a virgin? THAT is a pessimistic perception, an OPTIMISTIC version would be to think your future love is gaining experience! :). so, who is the pessimist now? :P ignoring reality in a consistent pattern is a sure way to develop mental illnesses. Just saying. btw, in what subculture do you live where people screw their cousins? :/ if she was a transgender it could have been his cousin. ;) The Ne part of being ENFP deals with creativity in thinking.    so ISIS is Islamic after all?

"   btw chimp, you're an introvert right? Makes all perfect sense now... :P“: Just when I think I'm alien free...” o.O when is the alien due to emerge from your body?    ISIS uses Quran to recruit amongst moderate Muslims worldwide. Not amongst budhist, christians, Jews.    and the concept of Islamic State also comes from the Quran.    and you do realize ISIS executed verse 9:29 from the Quran recently?   you do realize places of the Netherlands are 10 meter below sea level for ages? Lowest being 14 meters.   so risk of flooding is not merely an average of area's below sea level. Also the experience and existence...   ... Of countermeasures. thanks, I just tossed my breakfast.    And please inform me, when and where did ISIS say they are against Islamic teachings from the Quran?  that is correct, we have both. Our tech is even acknowledged world-wide.Can you fly that thing? Not yet.    they use the literal version of the Quran. With the Quran in hand they recruit moderate muslims.    you would expect moderate muslims to be able to distinguish between right and wrong Quran?    especially if moderate muslims know about true Islam?    there is nothing to debate. It is clear to all Quran is abused by ISIS to recruit moderate muslims.    you really want to debate ""ISIS recruits muslims by abusing the Quran."" ? You're delusional.    show me ISIS recruited christians, budhists, jews or atheists. You can't, they recruit muslims.    no, YOU are the real problem in denying ISIS does recruit muslims.      debate my first statement. Bring me proof that I am wrong.      yes I can, for ISIS did the same. Do you read the news?     I am referring to ISIS recruitment amongst muslims. can you even read?     again, i will paste a link to my first claim   READ this time.    this is something different. Scotsman dont recruit. ISIS do recruit amongst muslims. Simple.   don't waste your time Warren, Tariq continuously shows to have trouble reading and interpreting correctly. :S   but hey, that is what muslims do all day, interpret the Quran/Islam the way they see fit ignoring simple facts take a guess. :P     the question 'can you even read?' may seem rude, but is logically correct after Tariq ...     ... Ignoring FOUR times my first tweet      focus on the part where I state ISIS does not recruit amongst budhists, jews, christians, atheists...    ... and that ISIS abuses the Quran to recruit amongst muslims (whatever blend they are).    please, paste a link to the tweet Where you said this the first time? I missed it."	0
"    so when recruitment comes from Qur'an it is Islamic.       fair enough, my sincerest apologies for using ""can you read? "" as ad hominem attack.   it took you 7 tweets to agree and here you go denying again. As in your first reply     as I stated before ISIS abuses the qur'an to recruit amongst Muslims, for the quran is their only connection.   only with quran in their hand is ISIS able to connect with Muslims for recruitment. Quran is only commonality.   you continue to miss the point. It is not about the content of the quran, but about the quran used by ISIS.   I blame the quran for being so easy to be misused by ISIS in recruitment practices. The holy book of Jainism...  ... Cannot be used to recruit people to do violent things.Only Quran can be used by ISIS for violent recruitment.   and yet, ISIS IS using the Qur'an in their recruitment process. Why keep arguing against factual events?   even though quran doesn't teach that, ISIS is still able to use the quran to connect to Muslims worldwide.People blatantly denying factual events is the cause of most problems. OK, you're of the hook. For now...  are they? I thought Turkey opened their airport for usa Choppers to help protect Kobane? do vitamins also work against Islam?  I already gave you the walhalla about experiments    why do you even think I chose the brainiac name?  google selfish gene and find the book by evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins  and I already gave you this specific tweet earlier   to be real, if your unable to research tweets from the past 24hrs, how will you be able to catch up on all readings?  then ignore richard dawking for all i care, focus on neuroscience, lesions hypothalamus and their effects.  archetypes were defined in the collected works of Carl Jung. Archetypes are independently found amongst all ...  ... Cultures around the world and are typical patterns in human behavior resulting in complexes. Archetypes are...  ...

All of this should be discussed with the media, as a secondary point. Most important now are transparency, ethics and COI.    Retweeted, reported. The ethics point about bayonetta isn't quiiite true.           Did you only read the reddit OP? OP is for the 'operation'. majority of comments and both other links shoot him down. One guy (+ yes a few supporters) versus a lot of opponents. Polygon says ""gamergate wants us to do this"" It's very misleading. ... damn. I gotta process this for a bit. You have the right to complain. But this is advocating that publishers have power over scores. That's shilling. It's corrupt.  It is not reasonable. Publishers influencing game scores by withdrawing ad money is HUGELY damaging to journalism. Dude you have made HUGE mistake promoting 'operation bayonetta'. Changing review scores because of publisher pressure is corrupt.  Good thing she was already kicked from twitter about a week ago then, huh? hate speech? you consider ""i think this game is sexist"" to be hate speech?  Eh, I don't think the bayonetta review is 'hate speech'.   Not really. It says that the sexualization is gratuitous and meaningless. It doesn't say you're horrible for liking that."	1
" I'm a bigot because I disagree? Seriously, grab a dictionary and look up ""bigot"", ""hate speech"" ""corruption"" and ""coercion"". Saying ""I think this uses needless amounts of sexualization"" is not hate speech. This isn't gender/sex shaming. It's saying the reviewer doesn't like something. It doesn't judge YOU for liking tits and ass. Good to hear your voice again, and know you're playing games again. Makes me happy that you're getting on your feet. =) Or, it's because PC gamers' persona. You can't develop games on an Xbox or a phone. PC games have mods. PG gamers are ENGAGED. How about you interview some every-day-muslims instead of ISIL? I.E. people that support gamersgate but aren't harrassholes?This awesome project is still around! Get smarter and feed people  school meals   via     ""Nowhere on my site does it say we are journalists"". Oh? GamerGate   Hey, can we have a calm & rational discussion without calling names? Why exactly do you feel the Bayonetta review is hate speech? Tags alone don't mean much, anyway. gamergate feminism isis USpresident shoes see? Look at the whole person, not a tag. I'll send comforting words, but I won't finance their projects because I simply don't agree with them.That makes sense, right? Reported for spam. I'm sorry for you. I'm sorry that someone damaged you so much that you now want to see others hurt in the same way.  Sober is good. Relaxation is good. Being alive is good, even if it might not always feel that way.     Don't be an asshole, okay?   Can you show me? I don't like people harassing anyone. I assume you've already reported twitter? The bravest thing a muslim can do right this moment is to leave the religion. Because ISIS. Yeah, that rethoric doesn't fly. Decrying an entire group for the actions of a minority isn't the correct way to go. Weed out the harassers, not the whole. Is the harasser banned/removed yet? So link me there, so I can report. You're making it kind of hard for me to condemn harassment this way. Or rather, to act. I'd hardly consider that a bannable offense though. But yeah I'll see if I can calm some people down. Dude just stop it. It's not worth the effort because this guy will get offended by pretty much anything. Just ignore him. I assume by now you doun they consider pretty much vulgarity a slur and it's no use bothering. If not, well, now you have. You know what, I give up. I tried to be supremely soft, but even that apparently won't do. I hereby condemn harassment. Please do not contact me anymore.   I hereby condemn all harassments. I feel we should report them, particularly ones about death.   Here are some egregious ones that hurt me a lot, insulting me as a gamer.     Can we please report this  account for harassment insults and triggering?"	1
"   That does not give him the right to harass all those who didn't. I haven't, yet I am now hurt.   You are the one that started messaging them again, despite them clearly not wanting that.   I feel like I now also have to report you for spam, unless you stop contacting us from now on. will not ask again. Stop contacting us. In return I will not contact you. REMOVE ME FROM YOUR MESSAGES AND DO NOT CONTACT OR MENTION ME AGAIN. Also don't retweet me. I do not want any more interaction with you whatsoever. This is not a question.

Vandaar: ""Edit: Regarding deletion: The official reason the admin gave me was that it was a fuckup and they reapproved it now.""     Gamergate makes such a big deal? She's been on NYT, MSNBC, NPR,      Yet gamergate is the one inserting her into the discussion, instead of the media corps?  You mean, directly having a financial tie with the people you report on?  ""British gamer who disagrees with feminist critiques of gaming culture, argues on her blog"" - aangehaald als expert?  ""Cathy Young writes a weekly column"" - een nieuwsartikel?  Enjoy:  JennyOHenry cosmicglider 3lewd5me TechyFolks twilightpheonix  Grass is one of the most essential foilages. It worked wonders in things like TrackMania.   And Charles Manson was a vegan. Go figure. Volkert van der Graaf as well. Also Hitler! Clearly these vegans are a bad group.Dutch newsshow paints GG as a hate group, uses conflicting footage. Take note, be calm, please give them a day to respond cuz office hours. Then tomorrow, contact them and calmly explain why you disagree. gamergate equality fairness   Reported, retweeted. The media reject discourse and keep painting all of gamergate as a hategroup. They tell us to drop the hashtag, because it 1/? is tainted. GG are actively fighting that minority, because they feel the gamergate hashtag is worth cleaning. If the media so desperately want us to switch hashtags, let them create a clean one,  with traction, and move the discussion. Notice how the only one of those screenshots with the hashtag attached to it, very quickly got a bunch of reports? The absurd thing is they're not supporting gamergate. They're just against Gawker. ""The enemy of my enemy"" doesn't always apply.  No; revolt was based on anger at a dev sleeping with a journalist, a PR person, a boss and an award judge. Read them. I agree with you on many points. However I think that a distinction between those who want ethics and those who hide behind 'ethics' is definitely one that should be made. From the start there was this division, and yes, the hashtag is"	1
" tainted to a degree. But like Muslims/ISIL, Christians/KKK, I feel it's unwarranted to ask people to drop the GG hashtag. If anything, journalists should start their own 'fresh' tag with a decent amount of traction, if they want people to switch Don't do this. Contacting advertisers over bullying is a bit of a grey area but you decide. However this is unethical because there are conflicting interests. You're promoting a publisher to financially pressure a higher score. That is an arguable point, but even if we would agree, the methods you use are unethical. The end doesn't justify these means. Personally, scores as a precise number are bullshit, because reviews are very personal, and should serve as an anchoring point I know. I disagreed then as well.   I disagree; a reviewer may have biases as long as they're transparent and obvious. And we may criticize them for that. but we may not try to force their opinions away. No it's an attempt at reasoning with you. I'm not preventing you from doing this, I'm saying that what you're doing is promoting developers to force a re-review on one of their games, which would be coercion and would ruin journalistic isolation Everthing is seen through a personal lens, though. What makes a story good? What is good gameplay? Fast? Slow? An impartial-as-possible review would be nothing more than listing mechanics/bugs, and reiterating box quotes. Do you think TotalBiscuit is a good revie- *cough* first-impressioner?  Because he acts more along SJP ethics than many 'game journalist' blogs. Yet his opinions are strongly personal.  Example:   The intro makes it VERY clear he doesn't generally like puzzlers or platformers. Which is a bias. But because he's frank about it, I can take those biases in to account, if I myself do or don't like them. It's 9:01 here and I'm still awake. Give me a few minutes.  Our core disagreement is about the inclusion of personal opinion and biases, correct? I have to go to work in 20.  Shush. That's insulting and adds nothing to the discussion.  I've reported several doxxers when I could. They are now banned. Is that a specific enough denouncement?  I generally don""t demounce an perob completery, rather specific actions. Example: operatio bayonetta  I believe we should focus on bad behavior, not people. Everybody makes mistakes. Some are stupid, some are vile.  I denounce those that are actively inflicting harm, I try to esucate those who are dumb or ununformed.  those two accounts I mentioned had only negatives. They're gone now.  gotta work again now. Sorry for all spelling errors. On a phone and correcting takes too long =P Well he's not wrong. Sexism is treating someone a particular way because of gender. It doesn't necessarily have to be hate. For example holding open doors for women but not men. It's sexist, it's stupid, but I'd hardly call it hateful behavior."	1
