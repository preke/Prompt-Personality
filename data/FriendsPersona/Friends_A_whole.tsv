  Well, he came in for a massage, and everything was fine until. (A flashback starts Paolo, lying on massage table, moving his hands up Phoebe's legs.)  Oh yeah, I'm sure. (Flashback resumes with Phoebe doing a voiceover.) And all of a sudden his hands weren't the problem anymore.

  Hey, Felicity.  Yeah.  (In a New York accent.) Fuggetaboutit. (She giggles.) How you doin?  Oh, yeah.	1
  Did Joey say what he was gonna go when he left?  I don't know. Who would I have to sleep with?  Why would I have to sleep with you?	1

Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women. And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know? Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking...  No.	1
  Oh, it's my new beeper.  No, it's for when Carol goes into labor. She can get me wherever I am. I mean, all she has to do is to dial 55-JIMBO.	0
  Oh my goodness! You haven't heard!  Joanna passed away last night.  Well, she was leaving work and she was hit by a cab.  I know!  I didn't realize that she was so close.  No. Nothing. Imagine, if she had just stepped off that curb a few seconds later.	1
  So, I hear, you hate me!  A little birdie told me something about you wanting to rip your arm off and throw it at me.  All right, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, We've got to do something about our little situation here Joey. So, this is my idea you and me spending some quality time together.  For Chandler!	1

  Well uh, I went down there and told him that no one treats my friends like that and that he'd better come up here and apologize. I'll see you later. (Starts to leave)  He said that he wasn't gonna apologize because you guys are living here illegally, so instead what he's gonna do is have you evicted-I'll see you later.  Well he made Rachel cry!	1
  Phoebe, what? Umm...what?!	1
"  Hey.  Thank you!  You really didn't have to. (Opens the box) Wow.  Yeah. No, this is great. Thank you, Chandler. (They hug).  I'll be in in a minute.  Um, thank you for the gift.  No, I... I didn't mean the pen. Thank you for the book.  The Velveteen Rabbit. I kinda have the feeling you had something to do with it.  Well, uh, when Joey gave it to me, he said, ""This is 'cause I know ya like Rabbits, and I know ya like cheese."" Thanks. I love it. And I know how hard it must have been for you to find."	0
  Mom, we've been through this. No, I'm not calling him. I don't care if it is his kid, the guy's a jerk. No, I'm not alone. Joey's here. (pause) What do you mean, Joey who? (covers the phone, to Joey) Joey who?  Joey Tribbiani. Yes, ok. Hold on. (to Joey) She wants to talk to you. Take the phone.  She's not much of a phone person.  Hey, Knick fan, am I interested in your views on fatherhood? Uh, no.  Maybe you should.	1

  Oh, hi!  Hey. Gosh, you look soo familiar.	1
  Hi. You guys have any wrapping paper?  Phebes, it was your birthday, like, months ago.  Well, I have a call in about that.  Actually, this is for Kathy's birthday. It's an early edition of her favorite book.  Okay, but don't touch it, because you fingers have destructive oils.  Oh, it wasn't a big deal. I just went to a couple of bookstores, talked to a couple of dealers... called a couple of the author's grandchildren.  It doesn't say that. Does it?  Okay, all right, I'll just uh, make sure that uh, Joey gets her something really great.	1
  Hey!  Now? Is it okay if I go out with Chip Matthews?  What, that little thing at the prom?  Come on, that was back in high school! How could that still bother you?  Look, you and I went to different high schools...  You went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off Chip's motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket. I went to one where I wore a band uniform they had to have specially made.  It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes.	0
  We're really sorry, but um, she did ask us first.	1

  Well that works out good, because I'm not listening.  Oh, I'm sorry, did my back hurt your knife?  Yes.  Yes. Monica, you don't get it. It's bad enough that she's stolen the guy who might actually be the person that I am supposed to be with, but now, she's actually (starting to cry), but now she's actually stealing you.  I love you too. (They hug.)	1

(She spills something.) And covered in marinara sauce! Come on! Let me out! (the door opens)  That's not funny.  (starting to cry) I'm a good person. And I'm a good chef, and I don't deserve to have marinara sauce all over me! Y'know what, if you want me to quit this bad, then all you have to do is...  You do?  Well if you want a problem? I'll give you a problem!	1
  All right, cut, let's pick again, pick again.  Come on apartment! Come on apartment! (Picks a card.) Oh! I know queen is high!	1

  Oh my God, they took my idea!	0
  Oh please. Every moment is precious. Y'know? Besides, somebody had to ride in that other taxi with the rest of your luggage, and your friends don't really seem to care too much that you're leaving.  On no! No! It's not good-bye, I'm not leaving until you get on that plane.	1
  Cool.  Sorry, sorry.	0

  Well, maybe you could give to somebody else. Ooh, like Ross Geller.  Who cares? He works in a museum!  What is wrong with this freezer?!

  (Entering) Hey.  Whoah, ooh, why is the air in here so negative?  Oh no, how?  Which one?  No, which one? The right or left? 'Cause the left one is lucky...	1
  What?  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, the poem is not about you.	1
  (to Ross) Hi! Remember me?  Ross, I'm gonna go.  I don't know. Could be because I don't feel like standing around all night waiting for some guy who may or may not scream.  Good bye Ross.	1
  Yeah, oh, Princess Leia and the gold bikini, every guy our age loved that.  Um, um. It's huge. Yeah, that's the moment, when-when, you know she stopped being a princess, and became, like, a woman, you know.  Oh, yeah, um-mm. Oh!  No it's just that I got this new pager and I have it on vibrate.

Look, huh, I was with Carol for four years before we got married and I wound up divorced from a pregnant lesbian. I mean, this, this makes sense for us. Come on!

Well then you can't have any. (she grabs for the package, and it breaks open. Gummi-bears fly everywhere, some into the punch bowl on the table.) Bear overboard! I think he's drowning. (he throws some Sugar-O's into the punch bowl) Hey fellows! Grab on a Sugar-O... save yourself! (Mimicking the bears) ""Help! I'm drowning!                Help!"""	1

  Yeah, you have homosexual hair.  Oh, that sucks!  Maybe that's 'cause she's not really gone.  Hm, I mean maybe no-one ever really goes. Ever since my mom died, every now and then, I get the feeling that she's like right here, y'know? (She circles her hand around her right shoulder. Chandler, sitting on her right, draws back nervously) Oh!

"  (Smiling.) Ohh great!! (Putting the phone to his ear.) Hello. (He begins to escort her down the aisle.)  No, but it's okay. She just came in and gave him a hug, that it.  No.  Ah, I'm-I'm walking down the aisle...Still walking. (Mrs. Waltham takes her place.) I'm about to pass the bridesmaid I hooked up with last night. (Looking at the bridesmaid.) Hey!

Well what is it? Let me see. [Ross walks back in, Rachel's coat in hand.]  Ross, Chandler wrote something about me on his computer and he won't let me see.  And I'm in it? Then let me read it.  Come on.  All right, you know what? This isn't funny anymore. There's something about me on that piece of paper and I want to see it.  All right, you know what, that's fine. If you guys want to be children about this, that's fine. I do not need to see it. [Rachel grabs the paper and runs across the room, reading it to herself.]  What is this? Ross, what is this?  Kind of ditzy? Too into her looks? Spoiled?  Just a waitress?	0
"  (taking apart the invitation) Hey, pretty smart! Tissue paper! You're at the wedding, you have to cry, ""Handkerchief?"" ""No-no, I got my invitation.""  Hey!

  Hello, Waltham Interiors.  Who is this?  Where did you get this number?  Well, if you're one of Ross's best friends, why aren't you here?  Oh, am I on the radio?  No, I'm bored with you now. I'm going to cut you off. (She hangs up.)	1
  What?  Oh.  No. You know, sometimes just things doesn't work out.  Ha,ha, ha, oh my life is just so amusing. Could we drop it now?	1
  Ok, everybody, there's food and drinks on the table. Go across the hall.  Right now, Joey and Chandler's, go now.  Just go. [they walk across the hall]	1
  Okay, Pheebs, can I ask? So, hes going out with her. I mean, is it really so terrible?  Oh... Oh, Pheebs.	0
  So um, so what's up, you came to see me yesterday.  Ohh. . .K. How come?  What?  Huuh.  I, I don't, I don't understand, how can you be straight? I mean, you're, you're so smart and funny and you throw such great Academy Award parties.  So how long have you known?  And um, and there's actually a, a woman?  Oh. Well is she, is she the first that you've been with?	0
  I, Emily...  Take thee Ross...  As my lawfully wedded husband, in sickness and in health, until death parts us.	0
  He's just jealous. You'll fit right in; all Londoners wear them!  (looks around) They're all tourists.	0
  Oh! Oh my God!  You saved them! You guys! Oh God, you're the best!	0
  Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?  Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some hormones!	1
"  It would be nice after hearing 20,000 people chant ""You suck!""  What, look back?  Well let me ask you a question. Am I the Ultimate Fighting Champion?  Well I'm not gonna stop until I'm the Ultimate Fighting Champion.  Let me tell you a story. When I set out to create Moss 865, do you think it just happened overnight? No. There was Moss 1, that burnt down my Dad's garage, there was Moss 2 that would only schedule appointments in January, and 862 others that I learned from, just like I learned from this fight, never to let a guy stand on my neck."	1
  Here you go.  As a joke, this customer at work who has a crush on me gave me a $20,000 tip. His number is on the check, he just did so I'd call him.  That's Bill Clinton.  Oh my God! That's Pete! But why is Bill huggin' Pete?	0
  Phoebe's got another job, right?  Um, we should go too, I got patients at 8 in the moring.  I don't know, I don't have my jammies.	1
  Hey, guys.  Lots of responses.  (reading): OK... Dear Ms. Green... yeah... yeah... yeah... No. (crumpes up letter)	1
  I'm telling you, she said she's looking for a relationship with someone exactly like me.  Well, I added the 'exactly like me' part... But she said she's looking for someone, and someone is gonna be there tonight.	1
  (pointing to the globe) See there it is right there.  Yeah. But Sergei said it took the Germans six weeks to get all the way across it.  Yeah. Except for, y'know when you're on a date and you're getting along really great but the guy's translator keeps getting in the way.	0
  (on speaker phone) I'm really sorry but I may be a little while longer.  A couple of hours, I feel awful.  I can't!!  I'm in my boss's car!  Uh-oh, tunnel. (The phone gets cut off)	1
  Oh my God!  Why don't take care of this one, and should I get pregnant again, I'll hold onto your card, okay?  Three? You guys were worried I wouldn't even have one!  Well, yeah.	1
  Well, my apartment isn't there anymore, because I drank it.  Yeah, I ended up in the storage room, and not alone.  Ow, no 'woo-hooing,' no 'woo-hooing.'	0
  (entering) Chandler?  Well, I've been calling you, but it turns out I had your number wrong. And when I finally got the right one from Information, there was no answer. So I thought I'd just come down here, and make sure you were okay.  Listen uh, maybe we could get together later?  You got it.  G'bye, everybody.	0
  (entering) Okay. You were right. I'm in love with Joey's girlfriend.  I don't know. I can't--I just, I can't get her out of my head. Y'know? I mean, I'm a very bad person. I'm a very, very bad person. I'm a horrible person. (he waits for a reaction, when he doesn't get one) No you're not Chandler! We still love you Chandler!	1
  (coming out of the bathroom) What's twisted?  Ewwwww!! Ew! Ew! Ew!  He's fine!  Chandler?	1
  Yeah we do!  Are you serious?	1
  It depends on who asked.  Oh, Mon, sure.	0
  Hey, look, you're in trouble either way! Okay? If she comes back and sees me locked to this instead of the chair, she's gonna know you were in here. So you might as well just let me go.  It still wouldn't be clean. (Rachel makes an 'Eww, disgusting!' face) All I want is my freedom.  Freedom!	1
  So, did I hear Poconos?  Yeah, that's a big step.	0
  So how you doing today? Did you sleep okay? Talk to Barry? I can't stop smiling.  I know, he's just so, so... Do you remember you and Tony DeMarco?  Well, it's like that. With feelings.  Big time!	1
  And the advances in collating in the past five years, I mean we just got in an X-5000, y'know. The X-5000 makes the X-50 look like a T-71.  (seeing Ross enter) Hey, it's the dinosaur guy. (runs over to Ross) Hi, Ross.  I want you to met some friends of mine. (Introduces him to Chandler and Joey) This guy is my hero, he comes in with some stuff he wants it blown up 400%, we said we don't do that, and he says you gotta. And y'know what, we did it. And now anytime anybody wants 400, we just say 'let's Ross it!'	1
  (entering) Hey! (sees what's on TV) Oh God, is that Baywatch?  So is Joey around?  I uh, don't really have a preference. You?	1
  So, you're like a zillionaire? (Pete smiles and nods)  Y'know what, you should like, you should buy a state and then just name it after yourself.  Yeah, or, or, or, Mississ-Pete.	0
  Hey.  Yeah, we were gonna give fifty, but if you guys gave more, we don't wanna look bad.  And twenty-five it is.  Phoebs, let me ask you something, were, were these, uh, funny brownies?	1
  Here. I need to borrow some moisturizer.  Whaddya think? Today's the big day!  Thank you! (He goes into the bathroom.)	0
  Are you wearing my glasses?  Thank you. Is that one of my cigarettes?	0
  Oh, you must stop shooping.  No, I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment.  Ok, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not funny anymore.	1
  [to Rachel] I'm sorry it didn't work out between you and me, [to Monica] or you and me. Drew was very disappointed.  Goodbye.  Perhaps, uh, the three of us, just could. . .	0
  Yeah!!! Kill 'um!!!  No! Come on! Don't make me go long. Use me. They never cover me.  God, I'm not lame, okay. I can do something. I can throw, would you let me throw, come on this is my game too.  Thank you! Break!  I'm so sorry! Are you okay?  I'm sorry, they were just all coming at me, and I didn't know what to do.	1
  (Jumping up) Yeah?  Why? Why would you wanna... do that? Why?	1
  Outside.  Why not?  And that would be?  Joey, what's going on?  About what?  Oh my God! I love him!  My surprise party!  Oh stop it. Joey already told me.	0
  Well I. . .  [reluctantly] Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  No. Well, yeah, maybe.  What's 1922?  Yes I do, it's just that Ross is. . .	1
  Thank you. (Examines it) Oh, cool! Free sample of coffee!  Oh. Right. ...Oh great.  Country club newsletter. My mother sends me the engagement notices for 'inspiration.' Oh my God! Oh my God, it's Barry and Mindy!	0
  Her date tipped me ten dollars. (Monica laughs)  Pheebs, what are you doing?  Are you serious?	0
  Oh my god, there's an unattractive nude man playing the cello.  [laughing] You have some life here, sweetie.  I do. You didn't love Barry. And I've never seen you this happy. I look at you and I think, oh, this is what I want.  Well, not just for you.  I'm uh, considering leaving your father.	0
  Fabulous.  Become a drama critic!  By the way, he dumped me tonight after he read my review.  Yep! I sure know how to pick 'em, huh? Y'know I gave up a part on a soap for this!  Really. What?	0
  (entering) Hey!  Umm, yeah, uh-huh, they're implanted.  Well, freaked. 'Cause it turns out that the odds are really sucky. And! This is Frank and Alice's like only shot. Like, they are literally putting all of their eggs in my basket.  All right, I'm gonna go take a pregnancy test, right now.  Well the doctor says it takes a couple days, but my body's always been a little faster than Western medicine.	0
  Oh, I love my life, I love my life!  So great! He showed me where the restaurant's going to be. It's this, it's this cute little place on 10th Street. Not too big, not too small. Just right.  So anyway, I'm cooking dinner for him Monday night. You know, kind of like an audition. And Phoebe, he really wants you to be here, which will be great for me because then you can 'ooh' and 'ahh' and make yummy noises.  I don't know. I don't know. It's just going to be so great!	1
  That commercial always makes me so sad.  I meant because the monkey in it reminds me of Marcel.	1
  Okay? But-but imagine a lot more lights, okay? And-and y'know fewer bricks, and-and-and flowers, and candles...	0
  (to Kathy) I'll be right back. (to Chandler) What was that?  Kathy was being really nice and you just walked away. I thought we had a deal.	0
  I have an extra ticket. An extra ticket. Not, two tickets, I have an extra ticket.  He didn't turn me down! He's at the game isn't he? I got the date, I'm just not on it!  Wow! Monica!	0
  (plays with a thumbtack remover) Yeah?  Oh. Uh, I'm on. (picks up the phone)  (with a deep voice) Mr. Bing's office. (Listens) No I'm sorry, he's in a meeting right now.  Will he know what this is in reference to? (Listens) And he has your number? (Listens) All right, I'll see that he gets the message. Bye bye.  Ross says hi.  This is so fun. All right, what do we do now?  Most likely. (raises and goes toward the door) Okay, I'm gonna be out there.	0
  Well, I kinda wanted to sell the cookies. The girl who sells the most wins a trip to Spacecamp, and gets to sit in a real space shuttle.  Yeah. My Dad says if I spend as much time helping him clean apartments, as I do daydreaming about outer space, he'd be able to afford a trip to the Taj Mahal.  No. The one in Atlantic City, Dad loves the slots. He says he's gonna double the college money my Grandma left me.  The girl who won last year sold four hundred and seventy-five.  So far, I've sold seventy-five.  Five dollars a box.	1
  So she's a woman! So what?	1
  Yeah. Listen uh, I'd prefer it if you didn't call me Joey. Since I don't know anyone here, I thought it'd be cool to try out a cool work nickname.  (opening an envelope) There's like-there's like 300 bucks in this one!	1
  About what?  Heh... I was bluffing.	0
  Where are they? Where are they?  It's great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over some puppies.  Here we go.  Hey, Janice.  Hey, that's not good. Can I get an espresso and a latte over here, please?  What?  (covering) What... did you get me there?  Bullwinkle socks. That's so sweet.  That's great.  Well, I'm gonna get another espresso. Can I get you another latte?	0
  Hey.	1
  There y'go, kids.  You seen Sandy?	1
  OK.... um, a weird thing happened to me on the train this morning...  (embarrassed) Wha... what, here?	1
  (entering, carrying a briefcase) Hi.  Y'know, I forgot the combination to this about a year ago? I just carry it around. Do you have any Chap Stick?  Y'know what, pretty good.  Good! I haven't smoked yet today, I feel great, and-and-and confident, that is a stunning blouse.  Thanks  What check thing?  (reading the check) Pete Becker. Pete... (quickly grabs a magazine and opens it up to show her a picture) (pointing to the picture) Is this him?  Who's he huggin'?  This guy invented Moss 865! Every office in the world uses that program!  There you go!!	1
  Incredible! I met the director this time and you'll never believe who it was.  All right. I'll give you one hint. Warren Beatty.  Yeah, there's just one thing that might be kind've a problem. See, I, uh, had to kiss this guy.  No, as part of the audition. See, I'm up for this part of this guy, who the main guy kisses.	1
  We're here!  Long story, honey.	1
  I remember the day I got my first pay check. There was a cave in in one of the mines, and eight people were killed.  I worked in a Dairy Queen, why?	1
  (with his mouthful) Hey, I didn't stalk her. I mean (he sprays Phoebe with crumbs)  Aww. (tastes it) Ohh!  Put your hands together.  No more jam?!	0
  You found that handle, did ya?  Well that's not true.	1
  (sings) I can't believe what I'm hearing here...  (sings) What I said you had...  Oh, was I doing it again?	0
  Ohh, God, guys, check it out, you can see that girl's underwear!  (to Chandler) So? Huh? What do you think?  Not your type?! She's gorgeous!  Okay. Understanding a little more why you're single. Ohh! Y'know, I have a friend you would like, she's really pretty. And then we could double date!  Okay, I've got some ugly friends, and they're all available too.	1
  Yeah.  No!	1
  (coming in from his bedroom) What is that?  Maybe he found you flip-flop.  Whoa! Is this porn? What did I do? I must've hit something on the remote.  No, we didn't even pay our cable bill-maybe this is how they punish us.  Maybe we shouldn't pay our gas bill? (Stops and thinks about what he just said.)	1
  Wait, wait, I'm getting a deja vu...no, I'm not.  There it is!	1
"  No, no, no. I'm sorry. It's ""smelly cat, smel-ly cat"".  Better. Yeah.  Yeah, much better. And you know what, don't feel bad, because it's a hard song.  You wanna try it again?"	1
  You changed?  And lucky means, more cleavage?	1
  Hey!	0
  Oh good!	0
  Hey.  What are you doing?  No! You're clogging up the chute that I spent a half-hour unclogging!  Oh yeah, of course you don't!	1
  What 'cha doing?  What about the chick?  Are you sure?	0
  You could.... say you're sorry to her mom.  So honey, what are you gonna do about the little girl?	0
  I don't know.  No, it's not just that. It's justI want someone who... who does something for me, y'know? Who gets my heart pounding, who... who makes me, uh... (begins to stare lovingly at Rachel)  What?  Who?  Look, I am totally, totally over her, OK, I just... (Rachel comes over, Ross lays head on table): Hiiii!  We're fine, we're fine.  Uhhhh... Joey cried last night.  Oh, guys, you should've seen him. 'Read 'em and weep.'  No, women are welcome to play.	0
  Nice luggage.  Hi!	0
  Hi!  Sooo, you've been doing this long?	1
  Any luck?  All right, look. Why don't you just return the book, let Joey give her the clock pen, and you give her something worse than that. Like... a regular pen.  Aw, honey, that's so sweet.  Oh! Pathetic! (Grabs the crossword puzzle and starts writing.)	1
  Phoebe. Hi.  No. Have you seen David?  Well, if you see him, tell him to pack his bags. We are going to Minsk.	1
  There's a game?  Listen, um honey, I appreciate this but you don't have to keep hanging out with them for me, I mean, they have each other.  Alright that's great, then just go. Go Knicks.  Oh, then go Vassar.  Ok, then just go.  Oh, why does this bother me so much? I mean I don't wanna be one of those people who tells their boyfriend they wanna spend 24 hours a day with them.  It's just that he doesn't have that much free time, ya know, and I don't know, what do I do?  I've got a question. Richard made plans again with the guys.  Ya know what, I think I'm gonna go to my room and read Cosmo, maybe there's something helpful in there. Know what, at least maybe I can learn how to do an at home bikini wax with leftover Cristmas candles.	1
  Marcel. Bring me the rice, c'mon. Bring me the rice, c'mon. Good boy. Good boy. C'mere, gimme the rice. (Marcel brings the rice) Thank you, good boy. Well, I see he's finally mastered the difference between 'bring me the' and 'pee in the'. (Rachel ignores him) 'Bring me the' and- Rach?  Hi.  Really.  Whoah, uh, what happened to, uh, 'Forget relationships! I'm done with men!' The whole, uh, penis embargo?  Wait-wait. I, I got it. I was there.  Yes. Yes. Yes! Yes, I really do! In fact, it's funny, very often, someone who you wouldn't think could-could curl your toes, might just be the one who...  ...Gets interrupted. Hi!	0
  All right! Bring it on, you...  (interrupting) Oh my God! Play!  Really, bitchin'!	1
  Just us.  Although, I have enjoyed the fact that, uh your shirt's been stickin' outta your zipper ever since you came back from the bathroom.  So, do we have the best friends or what?	0
  What'cha gonna' do?	1
  There he is! There he is!	1
  Hi.  Ta-da.  Hi.  Do I? Thank you, so do you.  Sparkly. So, wow, this is pretty wonerful, huh. Mr. major capades guy. I, I remember when you were just, like, King Friday in Mr. Roger's Ice is Nice.  Yeah, well, ya know, I'm kind of spooky that way. Wooo.	1
  Oooh! I have something you can do! I have this new massage client... Steve? (pause) Anyway, he's opening up a restaurant and he's looking for a head chef.  Hi! (turns back to Chandler, then to Monica) Oh, yeah, no, I know. You're a chef. I know, and I thought of you first, but um, Chandler's the one who needs a job right now, so....  (to Monica's tapping) Yeah, yeah!	0
  Ooh, look at you fancy lads. What's the occasion?  Ahh.  Okey-doke.  Um, I'm getting a lily for my Mom. 'Cause her name's Lily.  I think on my shoulder. [Ross enters]  Um, a chip. A tattoo, I'm getting a tattoo.	0
  OK, sorry to break up this party, but I've got resumes to fax before work tomorrow... (gets up to leave)  Settle what?  Oh. Right.	1
  Yeah right.  Yeah, he likes porn.  Hey!	0
  (changing subject) OK, so at this point, the dealer...  OK, alright, last minute lesson, last minute lesson. (holds up two cards) Joey... three... eight. Eight... three. (Joey is unamused) Alright babe, deal the cards.	0
  [carrying an ice cube tray] Ice, ice, ice squares anyone? Take a napkin. Alright.  Really? I'm perfectly comfortable. [one of the guest opens the refrigerator] Hey, hey, hey, get in line buddy, I was next. [she opens the refrigerator and leans into it]	1
  Both of us? (points to Chandler and himself)	0
  Pheebs, you go with Monica and try on her green dress. If that doesn't work, you can wear my gray silk one. Oh, gosh, what am I wearing?!  Well, hon-ey. I'm just trying to look nice for your big night.	0
  All right buddy, way to go! (smacks him on the butt)  Thank you! Today, my boss keep slapping my butt and he was acting like it was no big deal.  Well, I didn't do anything. I didn't want to be the guy who has a problem with his boss slapping his bottom.  Yeah, I know, for a really great stew you just y'know, stick your head in between 'em.	0
  Oh, it's Ross on one of his drives!  Hi!	0
  Okay. (he gets up and takes the cushions with him, as he starts to leave)  You said I had to give you the chair, you didn't say anything about the cushions.  That's right! I'm taking the essence.	1
  OK, now I'm gonna kick some ass. [Phoebe grabs each of them by an ear]  Alright, now I will let go if you both stop.	1
  Hey, if mommy can have a wife, daddy can have a bra.  Oh, no-no-no, see, that-that clock's a little fast, uh, we have 17 minutes. Huh, what can we do in 17 minutes? Twice?  Hey, uh, you can ignore that.  Uhh, believe me when he's older, he'll understand.  I'll be right there. (He goes over and opens the door to Carol, Susan, and Ben.) (To Ben.) Hello! (To Carol.) Hello! (To Susan.) Hey. Uhh, Emily, this is Carol and Susan.	0
  Oh, God, oh, God, I mean it's just so.  Uhh, I mean this is like reading about my own life. I mean this book could have been called 'Be Your Own Windkeeper Rachel'.  NO!  No, why do we always have to do everything according to your time table?  No, see this isn't about the movie theatre, this is about you stealing my wind.	1
  Thank you.  Well, they uh, they-they do more than that.  Yes, Joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me.  I-I-I of course, I have more responsibilities than that.	1
  Hey, Joey, what would you do if you were omnipotent?	0
  That little naked guy would be me.  Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?  Got me.	0
  Oooh look! Isn't this adorable, Ross let Ben address mine!  Hey! Hey, did you get your invitation to Ross's wedding?  I'm so jealous you're all going! I can't believe I never knew that you can't fly in your third trimester!	0
  But my clothes are-ohh! (They both leave.)  No time for that!	0
  Oh, I ordered mine first.  Give it to me.  Give it to me.  [She grabs the coffee cup on the table and licks the rim.] There you go, enjoy your coffee.  [Chandler tries to come back with a smart-ass remark but can't swallow the muffin.] Quick, Phoebe, tell us before he can swallow.	1
  Hey, Bob, it's Jade. Listen, I just wanted to tell you that I was really hurt when you didn't show up the other day, and just so you know, I ended up meeting a guy.  Oh, hi.  Yes, yes, I did. In fact, I had sex with him 2 hours ago.  Eh.  Oh, Bob, he was nothing compared to you. I had to bite my lip to keep from screaming your name.	0
  (entering) Hey.  Oh, okay, except I broke up with Roger.	0
  What?	1
  Hi!  Yeah. Ahh, here's a box of your stuff. (hands him a box)  Oh, y'know, it's just like hats, and a shirt, and CD's, just sort of stuff that you've left here.  No. Ross, it, it just seems that y'know it's time we-we y'know, move on. I mean, I mean don't' you think?  Yeah?  Good.  Ross, you got that for free from the museum gift shop.  Okay, all right, give me the mug! I'll keep the mug.  You know how much I love that T-shirt! You never even where that T-shirt!  Oh, you are a petty man. You are a petty, petty....  Petty... (goes into her room)  Petty...  Small...  You are so just doing this out of spite.  Huh?	1
  Have fun!  Oh, I know.  What?!  Yeah, well, I gotta work, I'm sorry.  Because, I can't! Ross, I told you, no. I can't.	0
  (still hiding under the blankets) So um, who was she?  (still hiding under the blankets) Did you like her? And I'm just asking as a friend, because I am totally fine with this.  (gets up) Okay, y'know what, I'm not fine, I'm not. I mean how can I be fine, hearing you come in with her, she wants to see your bedroom.... (pause) Y'know what, what if we're friends who don't see other people?  Why not?! I mean this has been the most amazing week. Would it be so terrible? Even if we were friends who lived together. Or, maybe someday friends who stood up in front of their other friends, and vowed to be friends forever.  That's not true, you don't have a moustache.	1
  So, like, you guys all have jobs?  Wow! Would I have seen you in anything?	0
  Maybe it was just the kind of story where you have to be there.  Hi Russ, I've just got two more tables to clean and then we'll go, OK?  Hi.  Uhh.... waitressing?  [looks at him] Huh, Bob Saget?	0
  So, you gals wanna hand over your money now? That way, we don't have to go through the formality of actually playing.  Uh... to the bathroom.  I want to go to the bathroom. (exits)	1
  What? I-I said you had a-  (to Phoebe) Would you stop?  I said that you had a nice butt, it's just not a great butt.	1
  Yeah, well just be glad he's not playing a smaller instrument.  I know. And Mom, I realize you and Daddy were upset when I didn't marry Barry and get the big house in the suburbs with all the security and everything, but this is just so much better for me, you know?  For...me.  Well, what do you mean?  Oh god. I think I'm gonna be sick.  None.  No! They didn't even talk to each other. God, how was I supposed to know they were having problems?  I just can't believe this is happening. I mean, when I was little, everybody's parents were getting divorced. I just figured as a grownup I wouldn't have to worry about this.  Well, then, you know, couldn't she have just copied my haircut?	1
  Hey-hey, what's going on?  Thanks for telling me!  Ohhhh, good one! And Yemen that actually sounds like a real country.  Nope. (To Ross) Man look at this! Ross, I can't believe you said you'd play rugby. I mean look how brutal this is!  (pointing to the TV) Okay, Ross, look-look-look-look, look right here. That's called a scrum, okay? It's kinda like a huddle.  Ross! (Laughs) They're gonna kill you!	0
  (entering from her bedroom) Pheebs, you've been up for 24 hours! Go to sleep, honey. Th-this isn't healthy.  Hey! Didn't you have that outfit on last night?  Anyway, how did it go with Kate?  Joey, you had the night!  When two people finally realise their feelings for each other, and-and they talk for hours, and they-they learn all about the other person!	1
  See, Rach, uh, see, I don't think that swearing off guys altogether is the answer. I really don't. I think that what you need is to develop a more sophisticated screening process.  Uh, no, no, see, because not...not all guys are going to be a Paolo.  (astonished) What?  I-I'm, I'm having a boy?  Wha-I'm having, I'm having a boy! (babbling) Huh, am I having a boy?  I'm having a boy! Oh, I'm having a boy!	0
  (entering, with Joey) All right! Let's do it!  Okay, 'cause that's not gonna get annoying.  Hey, y'know what? I was wrong.	1
  Yeah.  Oh please, they're having sex.	1
  Check it out!! Jam crackers!  Yeah, the Knicks rule!  Let me see. (goes over and looks at the form) Oh, right.  Well, right after I did that sex study down at NYU. (to Chandler) Hey, Remember that sweater I gave you for your birthday?  Noooo, that's what I was wearing when I donated. I'm kinda surprised there's any of my boys left.  Maybe, I should call this place and get them to put my 'Days of Our Lives' on here. You know, juice this puppy up a little.	1
  Do you think they have yesterday's daily news?  Just wanna check my horoscope, see if it was right.  Where? (Turns to face him) Ooh, come to Momma.  We should do something. Whistle.  Come on, do it.	0
  Yeah, so no one touches the remote. And no one touches the TV!  Imagine a protective porn bubble if you will, okay?  Hey.	1
  Look-look-look-look-look, my first pay check! Look at the window, there's my name! Hi, me!  God, isn't this exciting? I earned this. I wiped tables for it, I steamed milk for it, and it was totally(opens envelope)not worth it. Who's FICA? Why's he getting all my money? I mean, what- Chandler, look at that.	0
  I just had sex.  Well, you never told me how old you were.  I wasn't thinking. I was too busy fallin'...	0
  Hey.  Listen. You are not going to believe this but, that is not me singing on the video.  Yes.  Well, OK, the record company sent over this piece of paper for me to sign, saying that it's OK for someone else to sing for me. That was my first clue.  Well, I can't work with people who would do this.	1
  Yes? Yes! Oh.  Oh, I was just here looking for, um, my um, my part of an old sandwich. Oh, here it is! Oh. (picks one up out of the garbage can.)  Um, perhaps. Yes! Yes, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I was just afraid that you were still hung up on my sister.	0
  (Looking out at the balcony) So tell me something, is leaving the Christmas lights up part of your plan to keep us merry all year long?  Hey, where you been?  Score.  Yeah, listen. Okay, before you do anything Joey-like, you might wanna run it by err... (he indicates Phoebe, who is helping Ross understand the remote control.)	0
  Who's this from?  Oh... (opens it and sees it is a pin) Oh my God. He remembered.  It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him that it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered!	0
  Hey!  Hey, why are you mopping your ceiling?  Wow, I have the spirit of an old Indian women living in mine.  The mailman was downstairs, so I brought up your mail.  Now what is Fabutec?  Waxine!!	1
  Okay, so we got some more good rejections, lots of stuff to work on.  Okay, um, oh, the zoo commercial.  No. They said you 'Weren't believable as a human being.' So, you can work on that.  Um, the off-Broadway play people said 'You were pretty but dumb.'  Oh no wait, I'm sorry, that's 'pretty dumb.'  Oh.  Yeah, no, I understand.  Yeah. Sorry. (she starts to leave)	0
  This isn't how it's supposed to go, there can't be another guy.  Of course there's another guy!! This is even more perfect! Now you have to prove your love!  You have to go to London!  Yeah, you have to go fight for her!  When Rachel was with Paulo, what did you do?  You sat back and let him have her, you didn't fight at all. Am I right? Do you want the same thing to happen with Emily?  All right then, go fight for her! Go to London! I mean, that could be you and Emily! (Points to the TV.) That, but-but nicer. Just, go to London!  Come on! Surprise her! Show up at her doorstep! Don't let her go without a fight!	1
  (returning) Okay, I'm afraid to say this, but let's pick it up where we left off.  Stop!! Stop it! You must stop! You are bad actors! This is a terrible play! I'll see you in the morning. (exits)	1
  (entering) Hey, you know our phone's not working?  I tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no answer.  Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got the peeper's name! Can I use the phone?  (to Monica) Can I use your phone? (On phone) Yeah, the number for a Sidney Marks, please.  (on phone) Yeah, is Sidney there? (Listens) Oh, this is? (To the gang) Sidney's a woman.  Yeah. Yeah, so what? (On phone) Look, I live across the street, (walking to the window) and I know all about you and your little telescope, and I don't appreciate it, okay? (Listens) Yeah, I can see you right now! (Listens) Hello! (Listens) If I wanna walk around my apartment in my underwear, I shouldn't have to feel like(Listens)Thank you, but... that's not really the point... (Listens) The point is that... (Listens) Mostly free weights, but occasionally..	0
"  (proudly) Oh, you should here me.  Look, I told ya, I'm not going to any clinic! I don't have a problem, you're the one with the problem! You should go to a ""Quit being a baby and leave me alone"" clinic!  Yeah, they do! Quit being a baby and leave me alone! There, you've just had your first class!  Ohhh, yeah!  I gotta do what I gotta do, you gotta do what you gotta do, you just do it."	1
  They're green?  That's not even a game!  You wanna finish this right now? All right, we get a deck of cards, high card wins. What do you say?  Oh, good.  Okay. (She picks a card.) Four.	0
  Something to do with numbers?  What?  You mean the mom you met in Montauk. She was a cat?!	1
  Okay, I heard that.  Uh-huh.	1
  Well, he's finally alseep. About that ah, bump on his head?  It's okay if he bumps his head, kids bump their heads all the time, y'know, it was your first time babysitting, I figured you did the best you could.  I know! I'm saying you have to watch them all the time.  Monica did it?  Monica?  Umm, did you notice anything wierd about Ben today?  Well, I was just playing with him, and y'know we were doing the alphabet song, which he used to be really good at, but suddenly he's leaving out 'e' and 'f.' It's like they just ah, I don't know, fell out of his head.  Oh, and also, he's, he's walkin' kind of funny, his left leg is moving a lot faster than his right leg, and he's in there just sort of y'know... (walks around in a circle)	1
  He asked you out?!  Saucy!	0
  Sophie's desk.  (whispering) Chandler!! Are you gonna call her!  Chandler!!  Okay, you are going to tell her and you're going to tell her now. (She grabs his nipple and starts to twist it.)	0
  Goodnight.  Oh, no no, I am.  Um, no, I uh, I have done it before.  I uh, I don't know, I guess I'm just gonna see, see what happens.  Wha, uhh, what?  OK, now I'm nervous.  No, no, I don't wanna put it off, I just, God I just, I spent last year being so unbelievably miserable, ya know, and now, now I'm actually happy. You know, I mean, really happy. I just, I just don't wanna, I don't wanna mess it up, ya know.  What, it's not your fault.  Really?	0
  Good night.  Okey-dokey!	0
  Sorry.  Hi. Sorry Im late. Wheres, wheres Carol?  No... No... No. I think I should stay, I think we should both know whats going on.  Okay, I'm gonna play my sperm card one more time.  I see. So what do you propose to do?	1
  Rach! Rach!  Hi! What are you, what are you doing here?  Oh.  Not yet.  Pretty soon I guess.  I just, I don't understand, I mean, how-how can she do this? Y'know, what, am I, am I like a complete idiot for thinking that she'd actually show up?  Same difference.  I get it! Well, that's that.  What?  Oh, I don't, I don't, I don't know...  I could, yeah, I can do that.  I can't, I can't even believe her! No, y'know what, I am, I am gonna go!  I know, why not?  Right?  Y'know-thanks! (They hug)  Yeah, well...nah.  Why don't you come, I mean, I-I have two tickets, why not?  Yeah, yeah, it'll be great! You can, you can lay on the beach and I can cry over my failed marriage. See-see how I make jokes?  No really, I mean, I mean, God, I could use a friend.  Okay!  Cool!  Come on! (They go to the jetway, Ross hands the tickets to the gate agent.) Here.  Ah! Ah! I forgot my jacket!	1
  Yeah it is. . . what?  Yeah, that was a tricky one. In reality, that operation takes like, over 10 hours, but they only showed it for 2 minites.  No one.	0
  Well, okay, I made a touchdown. It was my first touchdown. So?  Oh my God!  Woo-yay!!	0
  Hi, but I'm not here, you haven't met me. I'll make a much better first impression tomorrow when I don't have 20 hours of cab and plane on me.  Oh my god.  And the spitting?  We're on this bus, that's easily 200 years old...  ...and this guy...  Well, Ross and I were in grad school together.	1
  I'm hurt! I'm actually hurt, that you would think that I would send you any of those things out of any thing other than love. Hurt! Hurt!  I mean my God...	1
  Hi.  Are you a, uh, friend of Rachel's?  Actually, I'm a... kind of a.... you know, a... date-type... thing... of Rachel's.  Yeah, I'm her date.  Oh, you are the, uh... paleontologist.  Periodontist.  Ditto. [ROss approaches Rachel at counter.]	0
  Are you not seeing him anymore?  Oh, yeah.  It's morphin time!	1
  Hey! (Trots over)  Oh. (Goes and gets Phoebe's book as Rachel comes in from her room.)	0
  (imitating the characters) Tuna or egg salad? Decide!  (re TV) Ooh, she should not be wearing those pants.	1
  Hey!  And now you're giving me the message!  You actually think that something can happen between Emily and Susan?  Hi! Hi! You're crazy! Okay? This is Emily. Emily is straight.	1
  I think so.  Thanks man, but I think it makes a stronger statement if I ask for it myself, y'know.  Oh, yeah, that. All right, means that much to ya, I'll let you have her.  Well I don't like to say it out loud, but, yeah! Don't feel bad man, we all have our strengths. You're better with numbers and stuff.	0
  No, no, no, now wait, wa, wa, waa-it a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. That actually, uh, that sounds interesting.  I think you should drink the fat.  No, no, no, wait! Okay, okay. Don't! I'll go, I'll go!  You were really gonna do that, weren't you?  You were gonna drink the fat.	0
  Okay. (Writes a little more) I am so hot!  (Into microphone) Central Perk is proud to present Miss Phoebe Buffay.  (Into mike) Okay, that was Phoebe Buffay, everybody. Woo!	0
  Yeah.  Right. No big deal.  In Bizarro World!! You broke the code!  You don't kiss your friend's mom! Sisters are okay, maybe a hot-lookin' aunt... but not a mom, never a mom!  Yeah, well, you don't have your racket.  Yeah, well you didn't call and leave your grip size.  Ross, how could you let this happen?  You don't think my mom's sexy?  I'll have you know that Gloria Tribbiani was a handsome woman in her day, alright? You think it's easy giving birth to seven children?	1
  Hey, Rach, you know what? I think, I think I know what'll make you feel better. How 'bout you make a list about me.	0
  Ha. Ha, ha.  Oh, hello, kettle? This is Monica. You're black.	0
  (entering with Monica in tow) Hey!  Look who I found standing outside of the Szechwan Dragon staring at a parking meter.	0
  So big deal, so Joey's had a lot of girlfriends, it doesn't mean he's great in bed.  Sweetie, with you it's gonna be different. The sex is gonna be great, 'cause you-you guys are in love.	0
  No, not even close. Forget Vail, forget seeing my family, forget shoop, shoop, shoop.  Thanks, you can just put it on the table.  Thanks, you can just put it on the table.  Oh my god, oh, you guys are great.  Thank you. Thank you so much!  Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving dinner? What, what, what is it with you and this holiday?	1
  Oh, it's just... Oh, Barry, this was not good.  Well, what about Mindy?  No, not that, I mean, what about you and Mindy?  No. No-no-no-no, no. I mean, don't do that. Not, I mean not for me.  Oh, Barry..! Come on, this is all way too..	1
  Y'know when girls sleep with guys with weird things on their body, they tell their friends about it.  Brides magazines?  It is so weird, I know what I said, but uh, this morning, I was lying in bed I was, I was imagining what it would be like to say yes. (Rachel slams the magazine shut in amazement.) I know it's a little sudden, and it's a little rushed, and it's totally not like me to do something like this, but that doesn't mean I can't. Right? I mean I'm-I'm crazy about Pete, and I know that we want the same things, and when I thought about saying yes, it made me really happy.  I know. (pause) I need more pie. (goes and gets some)	0
  Hi.  Oh, that's um, interesting.  Alright, I got it Ross.  [hurt] What?  Hey, I was doin' great before I found out about you. You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie?  I didn't know then. And how come you never said anything to me.  Right, you, you only had a year. We only hung out every night.  Hey, there was one Italian guy, OK, and do you even have a point?  Yeah, what're you saying, you just sort of put away feelings or whatever the hell it was you felt for me?  Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross.	1
  Well, I'm guessing he wants to do a little dance. . . ya know, make a little love. . . well pretty much get down tonight.  Oh, she's goin' somewhere.  Hey, you feelin' better?	1
  Hmmm, that's very cool.  I can't believe she cracked your code!	0
  Uh, can I talk to you a minute?  This is really hard for me to say.  Oh, no, no, it's about you.  I think you may have a drinking problem.  Look, I am just not strong enough to be in a codependent relationship right now, OK?  Well, anyway, I hope we can be friends.  You too. [Fun Bobby leaves and Monica goes back inside.]	1
  (To Mr. Treeger) So you ah, ready for our last practice?  Look, you wanna use our place?  We did it!!  I know, it was amazing! I mean, we totally nailed it, it was beautiful.  Oh well, okay, good luck.  Unless you wanna practice the Foxtrot again? Or-or the Tango?  Okay.	0
  You wear bi-focals?  Did you know my husband has glasses just like that?  Rachel, you didn't tell me your boyfriend smoked.	1
  (looking at her watch) Oh my God, I gotta go to work!  Oh I don't know honey. It's gonna be really late.  I know. I'm sorry. Look, I'll make a deal with you all right? Okay?  For every night that you're asleep before I get home from work...  I will wake you up in a way that's proved very popular in the past.  Right.	0
  It's Erica.  Never mind, it's open.	1
  ...and that was all before 10 o'clock. The caterer rang and said it was going to be Chicken Kiev instead of Chicken Tarragon. And then the florist phoned to say there aren't any tulips. Oh, and the chilliest has carpel-tunel syndrome. We're not gonna be...  Well, up yours too!  Oh, that's not what it means?  Sorry.	1
  (running over and joining Monica) They'll never understand!  (following Monica) We were two miles from the house. Scared and alone. We didn't think we could make it. (He goes to put his hands on Monica's shoulders but for some reason can quite complete the action and pulls back.)  And then Joey remembered something.	1
  That's right! Where are the guys? I'm ready to get drunk and see some strippers.  They got a breakfast buffet.  Ooh, let me talk to him!  Well, can I just...	0
  Look at it this way: you dumped her. Right? I mean, this woman was unbelievably sexy, and beautiful, intelligent, unattainable... Tell me why you did this again?  No? What happened, big guy?  It felt like a 'big guy' moment.	0
  What?  Oh, I know, I never wear fake ones. I just did it so my Mom wouldn't give me grief about me biting them.  (Looks at her nails) Oh my God. Wait a minute, I had them put... (realises) Oh my God! It's in the quiche! Oh My God!  Okay ah, please don't freak out. Umm, but ah, there's a blue fingernail in one of the quiche cups, and there's no way to know which one.  Then why are you laughing?  What? You bet I'd lose a nail?  Frozen lasagnas?  You bet that I'd screw up?! So all that stuff about hiring me because I was good was...  You promised Dr. Weinburg, you'd never use that phrase.  (laughs) That's right. My Mom doesn't have any faith in me! Oh, that's hilarious! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.	0
  Ma?  Chandler? What're you still doin' here, I though you guys took off.  Are you naked in there?  Huh, you uh, you always wear panties?  Wow, talk about your bad luck, I mean, the first time you try panties and someone walks off with your clothes.  Well, let me see.  Alright, alright. [climbs up in the next stall and looks over at Chandler] Woah, someone's flossing. [Ross enters, sees Joey in the mirror]  Chandler's wearing panties.	0
  So what'd he say?	0
  Yes.  Thank goodness.  Really?! Well, that's just lovely, isn't it? I must've missed your call, even though I didn't leave the flat all day.  Oh, no-no-no, that's not rude! It's perfectly in keeping with a trip that I've already been run down by one of your wiener carts, and been strip-searched at John F. Kennedy Airport, apparently to you people, I look like someone who's got a balloon full of cocaine stuffed up their bum.	1
  Wait, he's not here yet.  Alright.	1
  This teramisu is, is excellent. Did you make it Mary-Angela?  Well, it's, it's yummy. So Mary-Angela do you like it?  So um, Mary-Angela, what's your second favorite?  Would you just please....give me the receipt 'cause this is great. It's top notch.  So will I.  Oh no-no-no I was just squinting. That doesn't mean anything.  Will you excuse me I have to um..... (walks to the hall)  (startled) Hey!  Look, I may have jumped the gun here. (she tries to kiss him, but he ducks it and moves away) Um, I just got out of a relationship and I'm not really in a, in a commitment kind of place.  Ahhhh, you're not Mary-Angela.  This is so bad. If-if you're not Mary-Angela, then-then who is?  Oh, this is soo bad. (doesn't see Mary-Angela)  No Joey! No Joey! Don't Joey! Joey!  (pats him on the shoulder) You're it! Now run and hide!  I wasn't sure which one Mary-Angela was. (all of Joey's sisters gasp) Look, I'm sorry okay, I was really drunk, and you all look really similar.  Y'know what, we should all calm down because your brother's not going to punch me. (to Joey) Are ya?  Joey if you wanna punch me, go ahead, I deserve it. But I just want you to know that I would never soberly hurt you or your family, you're my best friend. I would never do anything like this ever again.	1
  Oh my God.	1
  I'm in for fifty cents. (throws it in)  I thought, uh... it was a fifty cent limit.  No, I fold. (lays cards down, and gets up)  I'm in. (throws in chips)  One. (Rachel gives him the card.)  I bet two dollars. (throws it in)  I see your twenty, raise you twenty-five. (throws it in)	0
  Come on! Come on. Come on.  Hey!  Uhh, okay, it's uh, Emily and I, we decided to uh, to get married.  We, we just decided to uh, to go for it.  (turning around.) Umm, uh, I was just telling the guys...	0
  Hey, here's a thought, Ross. [reaches for the computer]  Ross, listen. I got two words for you. Threesome. [Ross gives him an insulted look.]  Ok, let's start with the cons, 'cause they're more fun. All right, Rachel first.  You could say that.	1
  Hi.  I guess you guys heard, Rachel dumped me.  Oh, all she said was that I remind her too much of somebody. You have any idea who she's talking about? [Chandler and Phoebe feign ignorance.]	1
  How, how is this my fault?  Yeah? Well, there's a lot of things Carol never did before I came along.  You know what your problem is? You're threatened by me.	1
  Hi.  Can we come in?	1
  That's pretty much it.  But you tell it really well, sweetie.  Okay. I'll miss you.	0
  All right, so who do you got it narrowed down to?  Oooh-hoo, very attractive, forgiving.  Eh, y'know what, she's to political, she probably wouldn't let you do it, unless you donated four cans of food first.	1
  Guys? There's a somebody I'd like you to meet.  'That' would be Marcel. You wanna say hi?  My friend Bethel rescued him from some lab.	1
  What are you ever gonna use that for?!  You got fired?!  Sweety...	1
  The guy was hammered, okay? There's no way, you look like Ross's mother.	1
  (entering out of breath) Jasmine?  We met at Phoebe's birthday party, I'm, I'm Ross Geller.  Yes, I did.  Very bad.  I'm agreeing with you. Did you, listen, did you happen to tell Phoebe yet?	1
  Ow!-Ow!-Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Y'know, ow!  She broke my arm.  No, she touched mine first!  So wait, what's the deal here, I can have sex with you, but I can't touch you?  No, your a masseuse, it's cool, I'm not a cop.  Wait that's-that's, what that's not what you do?  I don't know, I mean, y'know, this is the city y'know, I just, I mean, I don't know.  Oh, wait, no your right, no it was perfect and I can't believe that I screwed it up so bad.  Well, no, maybe-maybe it wasn't perfect, but y'know it was pretty cool, y'know, 'cause we had all those great talks y'know.  Well y'know about the tongue thing, y'know, and how I told you about my likes and my dislikes...  How-how I like to melt stuff, and how I dislike stuff that doesn't melt.  Yeah, y'know I feel like I can really talk to you 'cause y'know you're my sister, y'know.  Then I go feel your friend up and make you mad at me.  You hopped a little bit. Yeah, I really sorry.	0
  Alright!  Hi!  May I see your boarding pass?  Oh, oooh. I'm sorry. You are not allowed on the jetway unless you have a boarding pass.  No no no! Federal regulations!  Alright. What's the message?	0
  (Angrily.) Hey, were the hell have you been?!  I don't want to hear about her!!  No! No, we have an emergency. Okay? Rachel's coming to London.  No it's not great. No, she's coming to tell Ross that she loves him.  I KNOW THAT!!! You have to stop her!! She's going to ruin the wedding!!	1
  We didn't order cake.  You're right.  We're good.  Are you sure this time?  There is no alley behind Macy's.	1
  Why?  Oh my God. (Grabs Phoebe and turns her away) Phoebe. Don't look now, but behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into a pit of depression.  He's coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool.  We are not going to whistle.  No!	1
  Okay, I wanna be sexy again so I'm trying to catch a cold. It should be easy, supposedly they're pretty common.  What?!  Well, how-how-how is that possible? You barely know her!  You mean you stole it! (Monica sneezes again) Don't cover your mouth when you do that!	1
  Why?  Ohh! So, did you get to meet her?  (going over to comfort her) Aww, Pheebs.  That's short for Phoebe?! I thought that was just what we called each other!	0
"  Yes, you have to get her something, and it should be something really nice.  And not one of your coupons for an hour of ""Joey Love.""  No! I'm sorry, honey, it's just that last week I got all but three answers and I really want to finish a whole one without any help.  Hey, how'd it go?"	1
  You and Milton have to join us on the boat. Karen'll pack a lunch, you'll bring the kids, we'll make a day of it.  Oh, thanks, thanks. Bye bye Jeannie.  What a phony.  Sir.  Yeah Bing, what's that about?  This company was not built on rough numbers. Am I right Mr. Douglas.	1
  Monica, relax, go get a beer.  Who said it was for you?  You're kiddin'.	1
  Tampa Bay's got a terrible team.  He should take the sack?  Yeah, Ross. You and the baby just need better blocking.  Oh, have either one of you guys ever been to the Rainbow Room? Is it real expensive?  I'm takin' Ursula tonight. It's her birthday.  When's that?  Oh, man. What're the odds of that happening?	0
  Oo! Is it for my birthday present?  Yeah, but remember you said you ordered something special, and it just hasn't come yet?  'Kay.	1
  (entering) Hey.  What is ah, Rach in her room?  Oh what?! Is she gonna cancel on me again?! How can she do this? Doesn't she know it's our anniversary?  What's that on the bottom?  Hey, honey.  Hey, what's going on?	0
  Bye-bye Julie. [Julie leaves] [Rachel is still cleaning, Ross is laying on the couch. Ross kicks Rachel in the butt.]  Hey.  Hey, c'mon, cut it out.  What?  Sure.  What? C'mon, talk to me.  Why? Who's not having. . . Are you and Julie not, are, are you and, are you and Julie not having sex?  Wow. Is it, is it 'cause she's so cold in bed. Or, or is it 'cause she's like, kinda bossy, makes it feel like school?  No, no no no, don't need to know the details.  No, no, no, no I don't think it's weird, I think, I think umm, in fact, in fact you know what I think?  I think it's sexy.  Let me tell you something. As a woman there is nothing sexier than a man who does not want to have sex.  Oh yeah. In fact you know what I'd do?  I'd wait.	0
  (is struggling with the cat) Stop it! Stop it! She keeps squirming, trying to get away! Just like when she was alive.  Well, I'm not sure. I mean, I guess until she y'know, gets used to the fact that there's y'know, a new mom. Y'know, I think she's worried that y'know, she's gonna, she's gonna be replaced. (to the cat, in a funny voice) Well, that's not gonna happen is it? Noo. (gets up) Okay, I have to return a call in the other room.  Well, I'm returning a call from a certain mom at the B-E-A-C-H. I just spelled the wrong word. (goes into Monica's room)	1
  All right girls, and man. Let's see your final tallies. (all the girls raise their hands) Ohhhh, Debbie, (looks at her form) 321 boxes of cookies, (to Debbie) Very nice.  Charla, 278. Sorry, dear, but still good.  Oh, yes Elizabeth. Ah, 871.	0
  No! I did!  Of course! It's her favorite.  More of Grandma's teramisu.  That dies with me.	1
  Hey, what's up? (He has solved the problem of eating the steak, he's eating it with his hands.)  (motions to himself and Mrs. Geller and grins) You and me, next dance?	1
  Ahh, are you hadsome.  Oh, dear. Jack, how do I turn this off?	0
  Hello, Joanna...(Realises he doesn't know her last name)...'s office.  How little?!  Look, this isn't funny! You get back here right now!  Why not?!  What?!  (in a serious, businesslike tone) Rachel, could I see you for a moment?  Okay, here's the situation. The keys to the cuffs are on the back of the door. Could you be a doll and grab them and scoot on over and unlock me? And on a totally different subject, that is a lovely pantsuit.  I did break up with her! She just took it really, really well!  It did enter my mind! But then something happened that made it, shoot right out.  No-no-no-no-no-no-no!! I can't get myself right out of them! You must have me confused with the Amazing Chandler!! Come on, you have to unlock me, she could be gone for hours, and I'm cold, and (Stops and looks up the skirt on a statue behind Joanna's desk.)  Never!  Fine!  I-never borrowed your Walkman.  You got it! Here we go! Come on! This is great! (Rachel goes over and unlocks the handcuffs) Ahhh! (He starts rubbing his wrist)  No, I just always see guys doing this when they get handcuffs taken off them. (He runs over to where his pants are hanging) Hello sweet pants!  About what?	0
"  You're not gonna die an old maid, maybe an old spinster cook.  Hey now besides, if worst comes to worst, I'll be your boyfriend.  Why is that so funny?  Ha-ha-ha. A little to hard. What am I not ah, boyfriend material?  Okay, so we've established my name, and hit me. But theoretically y'know, I mean say we weren't friends, say it's a blind date. I show up at your door, and I'm like (in a fake voice) ""Hey, nice to meet, ya. Hey, oh-hey."""	0
  Thank you Rachel.  Well, I thought you guys were cuddlily sleepers.  Yeah. (they both notice where his hands are)  Yeah.	1
  Hey, Kicky. What're you doing?  Well, you're gonna.  Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?  Hey, you're not him. You're you. When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?	1
  [entering] All right. Tell me if this is too cute. Lesbian wedding, chicken breasts.  Why? It's not like I'm putting little nipples on them.	1
  Janice, I have something I need to tell you, and I want you to let me get through it, because it's, it's, it's not gonna be easy.  I think you should go back with Gary. I don't wanna be the guy that breaks up a family, y'know when my parents split up, it was because of that guy. Whenever I would see him I was always think y'know 'You're the reason, you are the reason why their not together.' and I hated that guy. And it didn't matter how nice he was, or how happy he made my Dad.  Yeah, well. It's the right thing to do.  Then don't leave me!  Forget what I said, I was babbling! Pick me!  No you don't! No, no, no, I say you have to give your divorce another chance.  Ohhh. Don't go.  No. No! No! No!	1
  Ohh, thank you for the wonderful dinner.  Ohh, thank you for my beautiul earrings, they're perfect. I love you.  Now I love you even more. [they kiss and Ross backs her into her apartment and turns on the lights]  Oh my gosh, wow. Monica. Oh my god. Mom. This is so great.  Wow you, you. I had no idea.  No, I knew.  What?  Why.  Daddy. [Ad break. Time lapse. Still at party at Chandler and Joey's. Rachel is talking to Chandler and Ross.]  Both of them are here, both of them, both of them are here?  I can't believe this is happening.  I do.	0
  Hi!  Wow! Skates!  Well... (he holds up a gift he brought her)  Yeah, sure, that'd be great.  Ah, which ever is closest.	0
  Yeah, but how much can you tell from a look?  What? [looks, feigns indifference] C'mon you guys, I don't care, I have a date tonight.  Yeah, Monica's settin' me up.  Oh what, my whole insane jealousy thing? Well, y'know, as much fun as that was, I've decided to opt for sanity.  Oh yeah, c'mon, I'm movin' on. He can press her up against that window as much as he wants. For all I care, he can throw her through the damn thing. [Ross and Julie enter.]	1
  Wait! Wait! This isn't take-out!  No, wait, please don't go! I've got porn for you too!  People are supposed to wanna hang out here!  I'm the hostess! Not those guys! I'm always the hostess! I mean, I was always the hostess, I mean even when I was little, I mean the girls brought their dollies to my tea party, I-I served the best air.  'Cause they took our apartment, I wanted to punish them. But I'm-I'm done now. They've suffered enough.  All right then, when I'm done with this place, it's gonna be ten times better than that place!	1
  Very bad.  Chandler!!	1
  Ring dammit, ring!  What?!  (investigating) I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off!  Nngghhh!!!!!!!	1
  Out loud?  So how are you doing?	0
  No, no, it's just my tooth.  No thanks, I have a good one too. I just, I, I can't see him.  Because, every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies.	1
  You're doing it again.  You're stomping. It's disturbing my birds.  I could have birds.  Thank you. I'm going to rejoin my dinner party.	1
  Hell is filled with people like you.  ...And boogie!	1
  Oh, Liam. So uh, what, were you guys playing soccer or something-or should I call it (In an English accent) football?  What's ah, what's so funny about that?	1
  Uh, (picks up a plate) plate?	1
  Hey.  How's she doing?  Well yeah, don't-don't you think it's a she?  Well, anyway, I got to go change, I'm ah, meeting some of the cast for drinks.  What?  Hey! Who was up from 2 o'clock this morning until 5 o'clock this morning trying to get her back to sleep?  Ohhh, here it comes.  Hey!! I need to relax! Okay? I was working all day!  That's not what I said. Okay, I just meant...  I don't know, maybe we weren't ready to have a chick.  Do you think we'll get our three bucks back?	0
  This is amazing. I mean, how, how did this happen?  (to Julie) It's an expression.	0
  Somewhere maybe along the equator?	1
  No! Do you wanna hear it?  Uh, huh. Yeah, right after I thank everyone for giving money to the museum, I sing a song about the wonder that is Joey.  Hey!  Wow, hello! You look great!  You see this, this is a person who is ready to go. Phoebe you, oh, you are my star.	0
  Joey!  I'm soo glad I caught you, I couldn't find you before.  They still want me for General Hospital.  Last night was wonderful. But I-I can't stay here just for you.  I'm sorry.  Flight's in an hour. I-I gotta go.	1
"  ..so, he said it was just a sprain, and that was it.  Not stupid. The very cute, cute, cute doctors asked us out for tomorrow night, and I said ""yes.""  What? Monica, they are cute, they are doctors, (spelling it out in the air for her slow friend) cute doctors, doctors who are cute!  Was that the cake?  I hope it's okay."	1
  What?  Check it out, Giants-Cowboys. (He has a pocket TV)  No, it's the pre-game. I'm gonna watch it at the reception.	0
  Alright, alright, here's the chance. Monica give him cash, Rachel give him your earrings. Something, now, anything.  Alright, alright, you know how you say I never seize the day? Well, alright, even though he's your super, I'm seizing. [approaches Mr. Treeger] Mr. Treeger, here is 50 bucks, merry Christmas. [Gives him the cash.]  No no, no, that, that's your Christmas tip, alright. Oh, hey, do you think there's a chance you could fix that radiator now?  Yeah.  You mean hardball?  Excuse me, I'm seizing. Mr. Treeger, here's another 50, happy Hanukkah. Will uh, will this help with the knob getting?	0
  (talking in her sleep) Oooooooooh. (Rachel strokes her hand over the pillow. Ross mimicks her silently) Oh, that's nice. Oh, oh. Huh, Ross!  Ross?  You are. Well, um... We, we, we were just... Wow!  What?	0
  (patting his clothes like he is looking for his wallet) No, no he's not.	1
  How far'd ya get?  Phoebs, what's goin' on?  Well, maybe he's, maybe he's this really cool pharmacist guy.  Phoebs, that's OK. You took a big step today.	1
"  Hey, Lizzie.  I brought you alphabet soup.  Yes. But I left in the Ys. 'Cause, y'know, ""sometimes y"". Uh, I also have something else for you. (She searches in her purse.)  No, but would you like a thousand dollars and a football phone?  I know.  No, I want you to have it. I don't want it.  Oh, that's fine, no."	0
  Do something..... Something....  Hey.  Have you seen Monica?  (With a confused look on his face.) What?	1
  Come on, she'll be here any minute.  Oh...  Well maybe we can make a, a, a 'B' out of one of those roses.	0
  Cut.	1
  Yeah, I know exactly what she's goin' through.  She told us.	1
  All right. Let's say I had slept with Mark. Would you have been able to forgive me?  You'd be okay if you knew that Mark had kissed me, and been naked with me, and made love to me?  You knew that our hot, sweaty, writhing bodies were....  I'm thinking, I'm gonna order a pizza.	1
  Your cappucino sir.  Ya know I think this is much better than the coffee house.  Well the package says you have to uh, constantly keep it moving. Stir and drink, stir and drink, never let it settle. [they both try to drink while continuously stirring]  Ok.  No?  Alright, hang on a second there Custer.	0
  Excuse me, that's 50 bucks.  Five oh dollars.	1
  I-I mean I, well I think I can figure it out. I guess y'know I was born, and everyone started lying their asses off!  How close?  I don't even know how that would work!  (interrupting) I'm not asking!  Yeah. Let's see, my had Mom killed herself, and my Dad had run off, and I was living in a Gremlin with a guy named Cindy who talked to his hand.	1
  Six-hour trip to London. That's a lot of Monica.  Condoms, dude!  Don't read my condoms!	0
  Tell him.  Just...please tell him.  Look at you, you won't even look at him.	1
  [enters] Hey you guys, you will never guess who's coming to New York.  Oh ok, Ryan, that guy I went out with, who's in the Navy. [Chandler is visibly upset]  Yeah, I met him when I was playing guitar in Washington Square Park. Ryan threw in salt water taffy 'cause he didn't have any change.  No. No, he is my submaring guy. He resurfaces like every couple years and we have the most amazing three days together. Only this time he's coming for two weeks. Two whole weeks, which means yay.	0
  Fine, let's do it.  Okay, you guys uh, you guys pick first  That's a low one!  Why are you screaming and hugging?	1
  (entering) Hey!  Maybe you can tell me. My agent would like to know why I didn't show up at the audition I didn't know I had today. The first good thing she gets me in weeks. How could you not give me the message?!  How is it you?  Yep, that's my audition.  Well, Estelle tried, you know. The casting director told her that I missed my chance.  Pheebs, you can't do that. The casting director doesn't talk to friends, she only talks to agents.  What, what are you doing? What are you doing?  Hang up, hang up. (reaches with his good arm, but Phoebe grabs it and he tries to reach the phone with his other arm but can't because of the sling.)	0
  Can't you see what's going on here, this man is dying.  Can't you see what's going on here, this man is dying.	1
  (closing the fridge in disgust) Shoot! We're out of soda.  Really?!  Sweety, what are you talking about?	1
  (something in Italian)  (pointing at game) Monopoly!	0
  Uhhhaahh.  Yeah alright. What're these, raisins?	1
  I know, I know, I'm such an idiot. I guess I should have caught on when she started going to the dentist four and five times a week. I mean, how clean can teeth get?  Well, you might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers, say her-	1
  [opens the drapes] Hey, Ross! What are you doin'?  Oh, yeah, I do. [He opens the window, Ross comes in, soaked.]	1
  What was all that about?	1
  By the way, Chandler. I cut you out of all my pictures. So if you want, I have a bag with just your heads.  Oh, are you sure? Really? Because you know, you could make little puppets out of them, and you could use them in your theater of cruelty.	1
  (reading the newspaper) Hey, here's a question; where did you guys get the finest oak East of the Mississippi?  I'm reading your ad.  Yeah.	1
  That's nice... now, was that before or after you told him to stop calling, stop sending you flowers and to generally leave you alone, hmm?  That's, that's nice twice!	1
  (standing up) Yo! Can I have your attention, please, Best Man, making a toast here. Thank you. (clears throat, and starts reading his toast) I remember when Barry got home from his first date with Rachel...  What, (to Barry) you hired the same band I can't use the same speech. (gets a 'da-doom-chesh' from the drummer) Thank you, thank you very much. Anyway, I wish you both a wonderful life together. And Rachel...  No, no, no now in all seriousness, its not a lot of women would've had the guts to come back here tonight, and even fewer, who would do it with their asses hanging out! (da-doom-chesh)	0
  Multiple, so many paper cuts.  (sarcastic) Oh, well give me the phone then.  Look, you can't call somebody after this long just to say, 'In case you didn't notice, I don't like you!'  Nooo!! She's really dull! And she gets this gross mascara goop thing in the corner of her eye!	0
  I found it. Finders keepers, losers weepers. (Ross looks at Chandler for help.)  No.	1
  Hey!  I'm sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt.  No! I'm putting that in my room.  Back when you and Rachel were together, if Chandler had kissed her, would you hear him out?  Five years.  Hey! Don't do the crime if you can't do the time.  No, was my best friend. Anyway, I don't know why you're pushing for him so hard. With him out of the way as my best friend, there's a spot open.	1
  Enough with geography for the insane, okay? Let's play some ball, guys.  Okay, y'know what, let's just cut to the chase here. Okay? Heidi, which of my boys do you like?  Yeah, y'know for dating, general merriment, taking back to your windmill...	1
  Really!  Did you ever do the-the Leia thing?  Really! That-that great huh?  Hi you guys!  Mon. Hi!  Why aren't you at work?  Why?  You really, really need to get some sleep, honey.  Hi.	1
  Hi!  Wow! Have you ever rescued anyone from a burning building before?	0
  Oh Monica, listen, I ah, I saw down at the hardware store, they got those designer tiles on sale. If you ever want to redo the bathroom floor.  Nothing. It's just old and dingy, that's all.  Oh yeah. If you ah, move your hamper, you see what color the tile used to be. (Monica gasps) Yeah.  Relax. Here hold this (hands her his beer). This old stuff just comes right off. (he bends down to try and lift some tile right in the middle of the floor, in his tight pants.)	0
  No, you are not, you are very attractive. You know what, I go through the exact same thing. Every time I put on a little weight, I start questioning everyting.  No, not wieght... y'know, more like insulation.	0
  Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne...  Boys? We're going in.	1
  Wait a minute, the house was built on radioactive waste, and an ancient Indian burial ground? That would never happen.  Sure, what's up?  I-I know. Well if something comes up... (walks away)	1
"  But Mon, you have to get our money!  I know, it's tough. You know what the first thing I did after my mother's funeral was?  Pay the caterer! Look, I've had a lot of jobs, okay, and there are some people who just always try to get out of paying. It's either, you know, ""that massage wasn't long enough, or, ""I don't recognize any of those songs,"" or, you know, ""these sombreros aren't big enough. Bad little white girl!"""	1
"  Fruitflies?  No! No dessert, just a check, please.  No, no, I am, but only because for the last hour and a half I've been playing the movie Diner in my head.  Oy. Look, I've been through a divorce, trust me you're gonna be fine. You just can't see it now because you haven't had any closure.  Well, you know, there's no one way really, it's just, you know, whatever it takes so that you can finally say to him, ""I'm over you."""	1
  Man, I am so beat.  Hey, you just wanna forget about raquetball and hang out here?  Ok, there is one more way to say it, who knows it?  No actually, I was just going for colorful.  What just happened?  That, that is funny. Can I have it back?  No?	1
  Hello?  (to everyone) It's Chandler! (on phone) Are you OK?  What?  I have no idea what you just said.	1
  Nothing, nothing.  It's, I mean, it's nothing, I'm fine. It's my friends. They-they have a liking problem with you. In that, um, they don't.  But they don't see all the wonderfulness that I see. They don't see all the good stuff and all the sweet stuff. They just think you're a little...  Intense and creepy.	0
  I was laughing. (Patting him on the knee.)  Well I didn't want everyone to think I was stupid.  My mother's driving me crazy, but Ross is getting married. I'm happy. (A drunken man approaches.) I'm not going to let anything spoil that.  Well, thanks, we like him.	1
  (singing) Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat, smelly cat, it's not your fault.  Oh, yeah!	0
  I was thinking of doing it a little shorter, you know, like Andie McDowell's new haircut?  Really?	1
  Yeah?	0
  Hi.	1
  Oh good, I was hoping that would come up.	1
  Ok.  Yeah.	1
  Rachel?	1
  Well, we could count again.	1
  Hello, Monica. (to Rachel) Hello, greeter girl.  (unconcerned) Yeah, OK.  It's a lovely apartment.  I was just being polite, but, alright.	0
  She barely knows me. We just live in the same building.  She lent me an egg once.  Aw, right.  Hey. (stutters something incoherent)  An egg?	1
  It's a beautiful thing.  I would have to say that is an 'L'-shaped bracket.  I have no idea.  All finished!  Yes, please don't spoil all this fun.	0
  (singing)  They're tiny and chubby and so sweet to touch, and soon they'll grow up and resent you so much. Now they're yelling at you and you don't know why, you cry and you cry and you cry. And you cry and you cry and you cry...  Thanks, Ross.  Ok.  Oh, look, twins. Hi, guys. Oh, cute, cute.	0
  Hey, stick a fork in me, I am done.  Like, when you're cooking a steak.  Well then, how do you know when vegetables are done?	1
  Um, would you like to come in?  According to recent findings!  (throwing food around the room) Here Mitzi! Here Mitzi!  My hamster. I hope she's okay, I haven't seen her in a while. Have a seat.	1
  How does she do that?  Would you look at her? She is so peaceful.  What's going on with you?  Well, if you want, you can stay with Rachel and me tonight.	1
  (hello) Hello.  (to Rachel) I love you. (Kisses her on the forehead)  (checks his watch) Two hours, that lasted!  I think so.	1
  Hey! Wow, it is true what they say, pregnant bellies look like a drum.  All right.	1
  (entering) Hey, guys. I'm here to pick out my Christmas tree.	1
  Ooh! I thought of a good flaw! Ross pops his gum!  Yeah, I know. It drives me crazy.  I'll get it.  Hello.  Hey, Joey! Hey! Ooh! Ooh! I just say someone on the-that looks just like you on the subway. And I was gonna go over and say 'hi!' but then I figured, he doesn't care if he looks like you.  Ohh, they're having a great time with their Aunt Phoebe! Aunt Rachel hasn't been helpful at all. So, do you miss me?  So you're not homesick yet?  All right, the seven of us miss you.  Y'know, me, Rachel, the birds, the babies...  Of course they do! Or I'm just really hungry.  Ooh, the pizza guy's here!	1
  [upset] She's dating. She's dating.	1
  Hey.  Well, you know that guy that's on my show that's in a coma? He's havin' a brunch.	1
  Chandler, you called Janice! That's how much you wanted to be with someone!  You're there!	0
  But... he gets it back, pass to the middle, lines it up and... BAM! Yes! Could that shot BE any prettier?  Well, we had a table in college.  Nice moustache by the way. When puberty hits that thing's really gonna kick in.  Ok, just one more point.  Is everything all right?  Uh-oh.  Well.  Uh, you guys see me as a dad?  Uh-huh, yeah.  That's fine. Well, your other dad and I are gonna go have a romantic evening and I guess I'll just see you kids around.	0
  Phoebs, check it out, check it out, check it out, check it out.  Page 42, page 42, page 42.	1
  Well, what I really want is for my mom to be alive and enjoy it with me.  Ooh! Bath salts would be nice.	0
  Well maybe he's just taking a nap.	0
  Hi, Max!  Are you alright?  You're going to Minsk.  Oh, you are so going to Minsk. You belong in Minsk. You can't stay here just 'cause of me.  Oh yes, yes, yes you can. Just say, um, 'Phoebe, my work is my life and that's what I have to do right now'. And I say 'your work?! Your work?! How can you say that?!'. And then you say, um, 'it's tearing me apart, but I have no choice. Can't you understand that?'. And I say (Hits him) 'no! No! I can't understand that!'.  Ooh, sorry. Um, and, and then you put your arms around me. And then you put your arms around me. (He does so) And, um, and then you tell me that you love me and you'll never forget me.  And then you say that it's almost midnight and you have to go because you don't wanna start the new year with me if you can't finish it. (They kiss) I'm gonna miss you. You scientist guy.	1
  (to Joey) OK, here goes.  I'm going to do it.  You come out there, you're a dead man.  Thanks. (Joey hugs him) OK.	0
"  Hey, if she were marrying a guy, she'd be like the worst lesbian ever.  No, I'm on right after this guy shoots himself.  Yeah, and she's really nice too. She taught me all about how to work the cameras, and smell-the-fart acting.  It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this.  There's my scene, there's my scene. [Joey on tv] ""Mrs. Wallace, I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon."	0
  You...are...not going to believe it! Joshua came into work today, and guess what happened?  No. But I was showing him some cufflinks and I felt his pulse.	0
  [enters] Oh my God, what's goin' on?  No look I wasn''t right, that's what I came here to tell you. I was totally hung up on, on my own stuff. Listen, I'm someone who needs the whole security thing, ya know. To know exactly where my next paycheck is coming from buy you, you don't need that and that's amazing to me. I could never do what you do Joey.  Yeah. And you should hold out for something bigger. I can't tell you how much respect I have for you not going to that stupid cab driver audition.  Great, how did it go?  Good for you.  You're livin' the dream.  All right then.  What?  [approaching the mover holding the parrot] Hey hold on, hold on. How much for the uh, how much to save the bird?  Dollars? You spent $1200 dollars on a plastic bird?  Go ahead, go ahead with the bird. Ok, do you have anything for around 200?	0
  Ohhh [turns as if to hug someone] Oh no, wait a minute, I have no one.  Na, forget it, it's probably stripped and sold for parts by now.	1
  What did he say?  Mommy is so proud of you. Hi. Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  We've got a cab waiting downstairs.  Tuesday.	0
  Your boyfriend is so cool.  Yeah, he let us drive his Jaguar. Joey for 12 blocks, me for 15.  You're welcome. Hey Joey, thanks for parking the car [passes the dollar back].  I think they get it.	0
  Tell me what?  (sarcastically) Oh, come on tell me. I could use another reason why women won't look at me.  Wow!  More importantly, was I any good?  Interesting, cause in my dreams, I'm allways surprisingly inadequate. (Monica pats him on his lap)	0
  So ah, whatcha watching?  What's it about?  Well, it sounds kinda stupid... (looks at the TV) Who's she?	1

Cause that's another thing that you don't wanna do, everybody That's another thing that you don't wanna do.  Thank you for coming everybody. There're cookies in the back.  Yay, I rock.  But.  I sense these things. It was either but or butter.	0
  Joey let me ask you a question. What does this light switch do?  Didn't it drive you crazy to have a switch and not know what it did?  They wouldn't have put it there if it didn't do something! How can you not care?	1
  I was.  Did she leave a number?  I don't have her number, butt-munch.  I'm not a baby, you're the baby.	1
  Yes, it was horrible. She cried. I cried. She threw things, they hit me. Anyway, I did the right thing.  Hi.  I uh, I just got back from uh, from Julie's.  No, no, uh, it's not what you think.

[Ross leaves.]	1
  Okay.  Hi.	0

No, it doesn't have a name. Umm, okay, Monica, what is your favourite thing about trees?  Good! Good! Five points!  All right, Joey, same question.  Ooh, three points. Both fine answers, but we were looking for leafy, leafy.  Oh, I have cards!  Yeah! Here! (She grabs a deck out of her purse) Oh no, these are the trick deck. Okay. Here yes. Okay.	0
  Oh...yes..is this..umm..Emily's Parents' house.  What are you saying?!  (Shocked) No! Ooh! Oh my god! (Dials again.)  (In a British accent) Hello. This is Phoebe Buffay. I was wondering, please, if-if it's not too much trouble, please, umm, might I speak to Miss Emily Waltham, please?	1
  Hey! How's Ben?  Hey, Ben! Hey!  Ooh, yeah! She said she's having sooo much fun with Emily.  What's too much fun?  Oh my God, you are so paranoid!  Yes!	0
  No-n-n-n-no! I am finally thinking clearly. My lucky dress wasn't working out to well for me, but for four years, this baby never missed.  Hi!  Ohh, yeah, well I wanted to give Emily a big American good-bye cheer. So okay! (Runs into the living room) Ready! Okay! Gimme an 'E!'  Gimme an 'M!'  Gimme an 'I!'  Gimme an 'L!'  Gimme a 'Y!'  What do you get? (She throws her pom-poms to Joey and Phoebe and performs a cartwheel.) Emily!! (Tries to do another one.) Emil-Whoa!! (She falls in Chandler's room.) Okay! So that's me as a cheerleader! Ta-dum! (Gunther's the only one that claps.)  I'm fine! I'm fine! I'm just losing a tooth, it's no big deal. I have a dentist! Y'know. I'm gonna go put some ice on it. Excuse me. (She goes over to the ice and Joey and Monica follow her.) What do I do now? What do I do now?  All right, come on, let's go get your coat.  Oh, yeah! Real fun. (She makes a decision.) Y'know, this bra... Really, bothers me. (She starts taking off her bra.) Y'know, this used to be my bedroom. Yeah. A lot of memories in here, a lot of memories. If these walls could talk, y'know what they'd say? Wanna hear some memories? (She is now violently pulling on her bra in order to remove it, but it isn't co-operating.)  Oh no-no-no! No, I got this all under control.  Ughhhh!! Forget it! (Sits down heavily on the bed.) This is, this is not how this is supposed to happen.  Can you not look at me when I say this? (He turns around) I thought that if I could get you here, I could seduce you.  Well, I'm sorry, I thought you needed them!  Why?!  You like me?  Yeah but-but-but you liked me! Oh my God, I can't believe this, all this time, I liked you and you liked me!  Oh no-no-no don't say but! No-no, but's never good! Let's just leave it at, you like me and I like you.  Oh, now see that's a fancy but.	1
  Awww! You know that's probably why babies learn to talk, so they can tell grown ups to cut it out.  Okay.  Sure I do.  Honey, you are in it.  Oh, yeah!  Well, uh, sometimes I think about selling my practice, we could move to France, make French toast.  Like a hound?  You really need the bassinet?	1
  (entering) Hi! What's going on?	1
  I can't believe you married Duncan. I mean how could you not tell me? We lived together, we told each other everything.  Of course I wouldn't approve, I mean, you were totally in love with this guy who, hello, was gay. I mean, what the hell were you thinking?  Please, when he left town you stayed in your pajamas for a month and I saw you eat a cheeseburger.  Well, didn't you?  I can't believe you didn't tell me.  What have I not told you?  Wait a minute, who told you? [turns to Chandler who's looking sheepish] You are dead meat.  Oh it's not big, not at all, you know, kinda the same lines as, say, oh I don't know, having a third nipple.	0
  Well, you just asked if I wanted to go to bed with you tonight.  (to Sergei) Boutros Boutros Gali.  He says he was too.  (to Monica) So I was wondering....  (to Phoebe, very quickly) Eh, he said, thank you very much, he thinks you look very pretty tonight, your hair, golden like the sun. (to Monica) So you're a chef?  Oh, really.	1
  Hey, Chan, can you help me out here? I promise I'll pay you back.  I will, really. I'll pay you back this time.  Well... I'm helping out down at the N.Y.U. Med School with some... research.  Oh, just, y'know.... science.	0
  Horrible!  No-no-no, the kiss was good.  No, but that's bad!  What?!  Can you really do that?  Chandler, I like Joey a lot, but with you...	0
  Bye, good luck. (Rachel, Ross, and Monica exit)  So how's your date with your cyberchick going. Ooh, hey, what is all that (points at the computer screen).  What does she mean by HH?  Are you the cutest?  You know, what I think is so great that you are totally into this person and yet for all you know she could be like 90 years old, or have two heads, or. It could be a guy.  It could be like a big giant guy.  We were just wondering if Chandler's girlfriend is a girl.	1
  Why don't you ask him out?  He just got a divorce right?  So he's probably really nervous around women, y'know? Maybe, you just have to make the first move.  (shocked) You've never asked a guy out?!!  Thousands of times!! That doesn't make me sound too good does it?  Oh, please!  I've never done that.	0
  Yeah, sure.  Did you talk to him?  Then, no. (He goes to sit down next to Ross.)	1
  So Pheebs, what do you want for your birthday?  Okay... Let me put it this way. Anything from Crabtree and Evelyn?  Ooh, okay... good.	0
  Okay, alright, I have a question, then.  Um, were you planning on kissing me ever?  Sure.  Oh, David, I, I think you are a sweeping sorta fella. I mean, you're a sweeper! ...trapped inside a physicist's body.  Oh, yeah, oh, I'm sure of it. You should just do it, just sweep and throw me.	1
  Oh hey uh, be careful with that 3-D last supper, Judas is a little loose.  They're takin all my stuff back. I guess you were right.  Thanks Ross.  I went.  I didn't get it.  What?  Huh?  [movers removing a glass parrot] Oh, not my parrot.  I can't watch this.  Uhhh, I was an impulse buyer, near the register.	1
  Ooh, you guys have to make a wish.  Come on, you know, Thanksgiving. Ooh, you got the bigger half. What'd you wish for?	1
  I Think last night was great. You know, the Karaoke thing. Tracy and I doing Ebony and Ivory.  What?  Then, I don't get it.  They do?	1
  (entering) Hey!  What are you doing?  Everything? Even the TV?  Listen, Joey, I know what he did was wrong but don't you think you could at least hear the guy out?  That's a good point. So uh, how long are you gonna punish him?  You've sentenced him?!  Joey, the guy's your best friend.  Oh, who? Me?	1
  (to Bonnie) Well I hope you have fun tonight.  Yeah, she was bald, she's not now.  I don't know, I hardly ever say that about people.	0
  Yes, yes, we did, thanks to Vidal Buffay.  Ok, I think she's trying to tell us something. Quick, get the verbs. (She hits Chandler.)	0
  We did?  Yeah, right.  Get out.  Really? You don't know what that means to me.  (provocatively) Nothing.  Yeah. (she gets up, notices something behind Joey) Oh.	0
"  Um, you guys, you know when I said before, ""thank you, but I don't really need your help""?  Really? Weird. Anyway, see, I planned everything really well. I planned and I planned and I planned. It just turns out, I don't think I planned enough time to actually do it.  If you want."	1
  Hey.  Yeah right after we stole his lunch money and gave him a wedgie. What's the matter with you, he's parking the car.	1
  All right, let's not jump to any conclusions. All right? There was some sexual chemistry between them.  Here she comes. Don't say a word, okay? Just be cool, don't be...y'know you.  Hey!  Oh, absolutely! (Chandler mumbles something.)  Okay, I... (Walks away.)	1
  Joey was in a porno movie.  If I'm goin' down, I'm takin' everybody with me.	1
  So, tell me. Was it like you and Chandler, and then you and me, or you and me and Chandler?  What?	1
  How do you feel?  Some moms do that.  Aww, sweetie, but it's not like you're not gonna have anything. You're gonna have nieces and nephews, and some ways that's even better.  I mean, you're the one they're gonna come to when they wanna run away from home, and the one they talk to about sex.  Yeah.  Oh, sweetie! (They all hug.)	0
  (holding a lure) So now, what is this now?  (laughs and picks up another lure) And this?  (laughs harder) You make it so funny.	0
  Hey!  Check this out? Huh? (Joey has this big tall hat with a British flag on the front of it.) Yeah. That's the stuff. What do you think?  Well, I like it. Here you go. (He pays for the hat.)  Oh, I embarrass you?	0
  What?..... What, you wanna spell it out with noodles?  Oh, so there is gonna be a fifth date?  Yeah... yeah, I think there is. -What were you gonna say?  (spitting out her drink in shock) Oh God, oh God, I am sorry... I am so sorry...  I know being spit on is probably not what you need right now. Um... how long?	1
"  Don't stare. Now she just finished throwing his clothes off the balcony, now there's just a lot of gesturing and arm-waving, (shows Rachel gesturing with hands in front of her chest), Ok, that is either, ""How could you?"" or, ""Enormous breasts!"" Here he comes!  Paolo, I really hate you for what you did to Rachel, (hands him a lasagna) but I still have five of these, so heat it at 375 until the cheese bubbles.  Oh, you're right."	1
  (intrigued) Yeah?  ..Naughty!  Oh, hold up, I'll walk out with you. Now, Rach, when she taught you to kiss, you were at camp, and.. were you wearing any kinda little uniform, or- (Rachel exits and slams the door in his face.) That's fine, yeah...	0
  You think I need a new walk?  Well y'know, I've been walking the same way since high school. Y'know, y'know how some guys they walk into a room and everybody takes notice. I think I need a 'take notice' walk.  Whoa-ho-ho! (He looks at Chandler, who gives him a 'come on' look.) Yeah, okay.	1
  Okay, so on our no-date evening, three of you now have dates.  Four.  Five. (Buries his head in his hands)  Okay, so I'm gonna be the only one standing there alone when the ball drops?  Hey, y'know, this is so not what I needed right now.  Oh, it's-it's Marcel. He keeps shutting me out, y'know? He's walking around all the time dragging his hands...  Really.  What, uh... what juggling thing?  No.	1
  Closed set. We know but we're friends with the monkey. [guard lets them in]  Woah, dude, burn.	1
  Well, it's official there are no good movies.  Hey, man. What's up?  Well, I'll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me.	0
  No, no, wait. (checks Ross's itinerary) His flight doesn't leave for another forty-five more minutes.  From here to the airport?  Rachel, what're you gonna say to him?	1
  Oh, my Bing-a-ling. I'll wait for you. Do you even know how long you're going to be gone?  Oh. Well, I'll right you everyday. (Reading the address) 15 Yemen Road, Yemen.  Chandler?	0
  Hey, no way, that rooster's family!  What do you have against the duck?! He doesn't make any noise!  Look, we are not gonna...	0
  Hey, it's so nice to finally meet you!  Oh yeah, I'm so excited, I've never been there.  That would be great! Also, uh, I was hoping to catch a show so if you can make any suggestions...	1
  Yes.  I finally got my band!  Why would we be freaked?  (They're less than happy now) Oh.  Yeah, I've been thinking ever since you said we were having triplets, the best thing for me to do is to drop out of college and get a job.	0
  Oh, honey, honey, tell them the story about your patient who thinks things are, like, other things. Y'know? Like, the phone rings and she takes a shower.  Oops!  Thanks. Okay, now go away so we can talk about you.  Isn't he great?  I know, I know. So sweet... and so complicated. And for a shrink, he's not too shrinky, y'know?  Oh, I don't know, I don't know. I think that's a little weird, y'know? Vinyl.	0
  (reading from the instructions) After applying the Waxine and linen strips to leg number one,  Grasp one of the linen strips by its 'easy grab tab' and pull it off in one quick pain free motion.  Was it not pain-free?	0
  What?  Yeah.	1
  I know! I know, I opened it up and there it was, just floating in there, like this tiny little hitch-hiker!  Does, um, anyone wanna see?	1
"  Hey, how'd it go? How'd she like the gift?  Oh yeah? That's great!  [nodding, with mixed feelings] Aahhuuhhh....  Hey! Happy birthday.  No he didn't. [Moving it back.]  Happy birthday! I'm sorry.  See, you think it's just a pen, but then you turn it over and it's also a clock.  Oh, yeah... yeah.  [to Kathy] Goodnight.  Oh, uh, yeah... I just knew that sometimes when you're writing, you... you don't always know the exact time.  Uh, the book?  What do you mean?  (tongue-tied) Uhl..ell. By the way, in case you missed that, that sound was, ""Uhl, ell."""	0
  Welcome to our side of the tunnel.  You know, when you start get screwed over all the time, you gotta switch to low-fat.  Well, no, not at all, you're not terminal, you just, you just need some damage control.  She has to know that your not ready.	0
  [walks up to Rachel in front of the TV] Tonight?  What's tonight?  Uh, hello.  Tonight you're supposed to waitress for me, my catering thing, any of those words trigger anything for you?	1
  What? We took a walk, nothing happened. I can back with nothing all over me.  (stopping him) No! Joey, we swore we'd never tell!  (interrupting) All right!! All right. (walks slowly into the living room) I got stung. Stung bad. I couldn't stand. I-I couldn't walk.  I was in too much pain.	1
  (to Joey) Hey! So since we're getting off early, do you want to go and paint mugs?  You know! At the place I told you about last night?  Oh, okay.  I'll see you tomorrow. (she kisses him full on the mouth.)  G'night. (exits)	0
  I'm not gonna gooo.  No, I think I'm gonna catch up on my correspondence.  I'm not gonna gooo, so I think that will accomplish the not going.  Well, ever since I was humiliated and yelled at in front of my friends, I'm just, I don't know, not in a museum benefitty kind of mood.  It's fine.  I'm not mad.  I'm just not going.  Right.  Um, hum.  No.  Right.  Right, and the humiliating.  Um, hum.  Right.  Yes, Ross. (turns toward him)	1
  Hey, Rach!  Hey.	1
  Uh, 10:30.  4:30.  Yeah. Hey, remember when she brought up that thing about the three of us?  She was kidding about that right?  God, that would be weird it that situation presented itself tonight, huh?  Dude, I don't know.  Yeah.  Yeah, for sure. Okay. Probably want the first thing to be, never open your eyes. Y'know, because you don't want to be doing something and then look up and see something you don't want to be seeing.	1
  Hi, honey.  Good.	0
  Come on!  Come on, season tickets! Season tickets, do you know what that means?

Of course, he wasn't in the sales division, but still, I never ever, ever forgot that!  Hey!  We don't make enough fun of you already?  Oh-no, don't try and talk all normal with that thing in your ear.	1
  What?  Are you crazy?!  What?! Ross y'know this isn't even about you! I mean this is about Rachel and something wonderful happening for her. I mean you know even if you're right, what if he wants to sleep with her, does it mean he gets too?	1

  Three of your five, what?  Oh my God! You are giving this a lot of thought.	1
  All right, I'm here, let's ahh, get this over with.  Whoa-whoa, don't we need to do some kinda preparation first? Like ahh, get really drunk?  No, it's okay, but if I'm Marge, my breasts are coming out my back.	1

  Hey.  Seriously, you like it? This guy was sellin' them on 8th avenue and I looked at 'em and I though, you know what I don't have?  Fine, make fun. I think it's jaunty.  Hey, I'll be alright. I mean it's not like I'm starting from sqare one. I was Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives. Heh? I mean that's gotta have some kind of cache.  Chandler gave me word of the day toilet paper. I'm gonna get some coffee. [Phoebe enters]	0
"  Hey!  So uh, Emily called last night...  Turns out them Emily is just crazy about Susan. Yeah, they're going to the theatre together! They're going to dinner! They're going horseback riding!

Actually that-that's not true, in The Incredible Hulk uh, No. 72, Dr. Bruce Banner found... (Sees everyone staring at him and stops.) Y'know, ugh, nevermind, my girlfriend's a lesbian. (Leaves.)"	1
  OK, well, bye. [kisses him]  OK, well, bye-bye again. [kisses him again]	0
  It was.  Ethan, it's um... it's icky.  This isn't easy for me either. I wish things were different, I... If you were a few years older, or if I was a few years younger, or if we lived in biblical times, I would really...	1
  You wanna quit?  You do realize that you won't have access to our new full service Swedish spa.  Okay, Dave in the membership office, handles quitters. (Both Chandler and Ross start to make their way to the membership office.) Uh, excuse me, (to Ross) are you a member?  Sorry, members only.	1
  (entering, wearing Santa pants) Hello!  Excuse me.  Oh, yeah! You like 'em? I just, I went to a used clothes store and got a bunch of maternity stuff. These are sooo comfortable!  What?  Nuh-uh! They're maternity pants. They even came with a list of baby names. (Pulls out a sheet of paper which lists who's been naughty and who's been nice.) See, these names are good, and these names are bad. (Finally, she figures it out.) Ohh.  I don't know! How are the-the-the-the, y'know-You're clothes aren't funny.	0

No, that's my stepdad. My real dad's the one that ran out on us before I was born.  [showing her pictures] OK, look, see, this is him. My mother gave me this picture before she died, same guy.  It's not a blue screen... it's just, maybe it was just really clear that day. OK, I have to talk to my grandmother. [turns to leave]	1
  Rachel?	1
  What is this place?  I think we have an answer.  This could be Gods way of telling us to eat at home.  No, no, no. We were there last night. She kept...

  Forget about it.  So, assistant to the director. That's a really exciting job, I mean, you must have a ton of cool responsibilities.  So what're you guys gonna eat?	0
  Oh, okay. Will you take my place?	1
  Fine!  Nothing, I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm out of sorts.	1
  Oh, uh, Phoebe just started a...  Chandler, can I just say something? I-I know you're still mad at me, I just wanna say that there were two people there that night. Okay? Two sets of lips.  Okay, well, if she always behaves like this, why don't you say something?	1
  (jumping up in a hole that he is digging, he is shoulder deep) Hey, you guys! Take a look at this! (Chandler and Monica jump up and go over to the hole.) Check this baby out, dug me a hole!  Oh no! No!! My hole!!  (climbing out of the hole) What?! What?!! What is it?!  Yeah, and I'm a little tired from digging the hole.  Well, there's really only one thing you can do.  You're gonna have to pee on it.	0
  Yeah, I-I think that women just have a lower threshold of pain than men, that's all. I mean, come on, it's just a little wax.  Okay, fine, so now what, I just pull it off?	0
  Hi.  You wanted to see me?	0
  Why doesn't my key work and what's all my stuff doin' downstairs?  It's Eddie you freak, your roommate.  No he, he moved out and I moved in.  Well that's uh, that's a good point. Um ok, well, uh, I guess I got the wrong apartment then. I, I'm, look, I'm, ya know, I'm sorry, I'm terriably sorry.	1
  Alright, Monica dear, I'm gonna hit the road. Now I've left my 10 verbs on the table. And you be sure and send me that finished poem.  I think I saw Rachel out in the hall.  Happy birthday sweetie.  Ross, what're you doing.	1
  Hey. (Phoebe sees his bags)  I'm going to China.  Yeah, i-it's for the museum. Someone found a bone, we want the bone, but they don't want us to have the bone, so I'm going over there to try to persuade them to give us the boit'sit's a whole big bone thing. Anyway, I'm gonna be gone for like, uh... like a week, so, uh, if you wanna reach me, y-you can't. So here's my itinerary (hands a sheet of paper to Monica). Um... here's a picture of me... (hands it to Monica)  (to Monica): Could you take it to Carol's every now and then, and show it to Ben, just so he doesn't forget me?  Hey, is Rachel here? Um, I wanted to wish her a happy birthday before I left.  Oh. (pause) Hey, who's Carl?  No.  At the coffeehouse, right.  OK, I'm gonna go say goodbye to the guys.  Hi.

I don'tI don't know. Alright, just... just give her this for me, OK? (gives Chandler a gift for Rachel)  I know.	1
  Okay, time to take off the bra. (She glares at him.)  (trying not to be obvious) Take the bra off.	1
  Monica, wake up. Monica.  I thought of a thing.  Yeah. I have to sleep, have to, on this side of the bed.  Or so I would have you believe.	1
  Howdy.  Well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed.  (slides the juice across the counter which Joey catches) What do you care? You're an actor. This is your day job. This isn't supposed to mean anything to you.	1
  Yeah, I guess. Look, what are we gonna do about this scene, huh?  Well umm, maybe if it had more heat.  Well, Adrian's looking for a reason to stay, right? Victor can't just kiss her, he's gotta, gotta really give her a reason, y'know?  Or maybe, maybe he could grab her, and, and, and, and lift her up.  And then she could rip off his shirt and kiss his chest, and, and his stomach!	0
  Hey!  Well, y'know if Joey and I played with matches we could get you up to an even hundred.  You're right, I know.	0
  I believe it.	0
  Baywatch.  Lifeguards.	1
  You were amazing out there.  Oh my God!  You really enjoyed yourself didn't you?	0
  Hey Mon! Want some pancakes?  Yep! Grab a plate.  No-no, stay right there. (Monica stops and Joey flips her a pancake, which flies over her head and lands in the living room.) Gettin' closer.  Listen also we're uh, we're watching the game here Saturday night, if people want to come over.  Oh yeah, who's playing?	1
  You're really thinking about having sex with your brother?!  Huh.	1
  I picked her! Oh thank God you want her! Ooh!  Because she exchanges every gift she ever gets, it's like impossible to get her something she likes. Come on, let's trade!  Ohh.  You don't have to do that, Ross and Joey aren't here, you can watch the parade if you want.  God, what happened?!  Open it up, let me see.  Ooh, God it looks bad.  Honey, you've got to go. What's his office number?  (on phone) Hi! Yeah, I'm calling on behalf of Monica Geller's eye, and is um, is Richard Burke in today. (Listens) (to Monica) He's out of town, but does she want to see the on-call doctor?  Yes! She's very excited about that.  This is so cool, 'til Monica gets back, it's like I'm head chef and I get to make all the decisions. (She looks at the remaining butter, and then decides to add it to the dish.)  Okay, get out of my kitchen!  All right I... I gotta call my mom and ask her a left handed cooking question.	1
  Hey.  Can you believe this. In, like, two hours I'm gonna have a dad. Eeeshk.  OK, let's go.  Alright, here, you have to hold this. [hands Chandler a piece of paper]	0
  Oh, we went to see a collection of Victorian doorknobs and the Cupert-Hewitt museum.  Yeah.  Bye. (They kiss.)  Oh yeah, she's-she's amazing. And-and she's so much fun. And! Y'know what? When I'm with her, I'm fun! I even signed up for helicopter classes. (Chandler is shocked.) She's leaving in two days, I don't have to do it.  Yeah, she's got to go back to London. But you know what? I've been prepared for this from the start. We both knew we had two weeks together, and that's it. Y'know.  Pheebs!  (starts rubbing her belly) Hello! Hello!	0
  What? What? He's interested in you. He-he likes your hair, he just wants to know how you got here.  What?!  He's got this thing. And I keep telling him to go to my chiropractor...  Excuse me, Dr. Bobby happens to be an excellent doctor.  Well that's his last name.  It's Robert Bobby.  And um, excuse me, he helps me.  With my alignment. I've got one leg shorter than the other.  What? It's true, my right leg is two inches shorter.  I'm sorry, let her?  No.	0
"  [nervous] What? Nothing. [Chandler closes up the laptop computer screen.]  No, no, see? See? [the printer starts to run] Hey, it's printing. [to Joey, rattled] Hey, it's printing! [Chandler rips off the sheet of paper from the printer.]  Yes, yes it is, short story, that I was writing.  [through gritted teeth] Alright. [clears his throat] ""It was summer, and it was hot. Rachel was there. A lonely gray couch. 'Oh, look,' cried Ned, and then the kingdom was his forever. The end."""	1
"  (singing) ""...fuchsia and mauvvve. Those are the 66 colours of my bedroommmm."" (applause) Thank you, thank you. Ohh, and I invite you to count the colours in your bedroom. (Sees that Phoebe Sr. has entered, and to her) Except for you. You go away.  Okay, bye.  No.  But, it's not like we're losing anything. Y'know?  It's not like we-we know each other or anything. Or that have anything in common.  I-I like pizza!  Oh my God, so do I!  Wait-wait-wait, wait! Puppies. Cute or ugly?"	1
  Hi, guys.  I-I wanted to apologise if I-y'know seemed a tad edgy yesterday at my shower. Y'know it's just the hormones, y'know.  Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you, it was just, it was so sweet. (She goes to hug them and they both flinch, thinking that Phoebe is about to attack them.)  Good. Y'know-no-no, okay, it's-it feels like everything's been about me lately, so what's happening with you?  Oh!	0
  Don't worry about it already. Things happen.  Joey, look at me, look at me. Do I have lipstick on my teeth?  Look honey, people get fired left and right in this business. I already got you an audition for Another World.  You're welcome.	1
  You went out with a guy in the Navy?  So wait, this guy goes down for like two years at a time? [Once again, Chandler has a bite in his mouth and can't come back.]	1
  (using calculator) Plus tip, divided by six. Ok, everyone owes 28 bucks.  Oh, you're right, I'm sorry.  Monica's big night, she shouldn't pay.  So five of us is, $33.50 apiece.  Ok, Pheebs! How 'bout we'll each just pay for what we had. It's no big deal.	0
  Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Is this, hot Rachel, that you took to the Christmas party, Rachel?  Oh wow! I'm free for her!	0
  Yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping!  Chandler, what are you doing?	0
  This is a great place. How long have you lived here?  So, Monica, what do you do?  Good for you.  This hummus is great.	1
  Come on! Like I wanted him to tell you, I ran all over the place trying to make sure that didn't happen!  Look Rachel, I wanted to tell you, I thought I should, I-I did, and then Chandler and Joey convinced me not to.  Don't you realise none of this would've ever happened if I didn't think at that same moment you weren't having sex with Mark?  (pause) Yes I would.  (less sure) Yes.  (covering his ears and screaming) La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la! Okay, okay, yeah, I would have been devastated but, I would still want to be with you. Because it's, I mean it's you.  What? Come on Rach, tell me what you're thinking?  Order a pizza like, 'I forgive you?'	0
  Monica, how are you gonna do that?	1
  Hi.  Hello.  Yeah, huh.  What?  Come on sweetie! You've had to work late every night for the past two weeks, what is it this time?  (to Rachel) But work comes first! (to Mark) Oh hey, but that's sad about you though, what happened? Burn out? Burn all out, did ya?  Oh well that's great, so I guess this is ah, this is good bye then. Huh? (picks a pad up off Rachel's desk and tosses it into his box) Good bye.	0
  Man, I feel like I'm coming down with something.  Yeah. (to Chandler) I bet you can't guess what color my tonsils are? I'll bet the apartment!	1
  Ooh, then I guess the panty raid last night was totally uncalled for. Ok, I am going to take a shower and today I will be singing Jim Crochee's Leroy Brown. [He walks out of the bedroom and Monica starts to remake the bed.]  Monica... [He re-enters the bedroom and Monica jumps on the bed, trying to cover it.] Hey Mon, I have a question. Is Leroy the baddest man in the whole damn town or the fattest man in the whole damn town?  What're you doing?  Are you remaking the bed?  Then, you're redoing it because...  You're pretty much running that risk either way.  Oh, well that's not so crazy.	1
  Well, Joey, I wrote a little song today. It's called Get Up.  Really!	0
  Hi, Joey.  (casually) Joey.  That's because I'm wearing a dress that accents my boobs.	0
  Hello.  Oh I'm afraid that plane has already pulled away from the gate.  I can't do that.	1
  You guys are dead, I am so good at lighting rounds.  Huh, wanna bet?  How about we play for more money, say 150?  You're doing it again.  We won't. (to Chandler) 300?  I'm just trying to spice it up!  I got it! How about, if we win, they have to get rid of the rooster?	1
  (to Ross) You be cool. (He opens the door and lets her in as they all turn there backs on her.)  Way to be cool, man.	0
  (to Pete) Wow! That's exciting, you went to Japan, made up a woman.  I'm just saying, this woman, I mean she's fictitious. No?  'Cause you're still into Monica. So you told her there was somebody else so she would agree to work with you, so 'cause you figure oh if you spent a lot of time together, maybe something might happen, and...	1
  Ok, Paulo, why don't you just go get dressed, and then you be on your way, ok, bye-bye. (Paulo goes into his room.)  I don't know, I just kinda ran into him last night.  At his apartment. Is this juice?  Oh God, I know I'm a pathetic loser.	0
  Ok, so now we need, um sage branches and the sacramental wine.  Um, that's ok! (throws it in fire) Ok. All right. Now we need the semen of a righteous man.  Ok, yeah, ok. (she throws the directions in) Oh, OK.  Ok, and I have the, uh receipt for my dinner with Nokululu Oon Ah Ah.	1
  Can you believe this place?  Ah, I was just in the bathroom, and there's mirrors on both sides of you. So when you're in there it's like you're peein' with the Rockettes.  Hey! We were just sayin', great apartment man.	0
  About what?  What surprise party?	0
  What's the matter?  No, it was. It was very very good.  Oh, way, way better than Mindy.  Well, if you want, I'll justI'll just break it off with her.  (into intercom) Thanks, Bernice. (To Rachel) Let's go away this weekend.  We can, we can go to Aruba! When I went there on what would have been our honeymoon, it was, uh... it was really nice. You would've liked it.	1
  Oh, here's that trench-coat that you wanted.  Yeah?  (stopping him) Oh no-no, no-no, they don't want you to put your hands in the pockets until you are out of the store.  Well, that's because of a lot of...(She imitates someone picking their nose and placing the treasure found in the pockets.)  I know!  Oh?  Well, congratulations, so do you love her?	0
  Did that!  Okay. (Does so.) Ow!!!!! Ow-oh-oh!	0
  Tell me about it. So what, what's your magic number?  C'mon, you know everyone I've been with. All, both of them.  Better not be doin' these in order.	1
  Liam, do me a favour. Tell the lads to go easy on Ross, it's his first time.	1
  (hurt) Waitressing?	1
  Honey, you can say it, Poconos, Poconos, it's like Poc-o-nos (touching Paolo's nose with forefinger with each syllable)  Yes, my sister's giving us her place for the weekend.	1
  Same category?  Michael Flatley, Lord of the Dance!	1
  Serious?	1
  That's all right.  Hey. (they all walk away from Chandler)	1
  What are you crazy? That's a baby!  Hey, you're gonna be fine. You're one of the most caring, most responsible men in North America. You're gonna make a great dad.  Well, only if you order stuff.	1
  (mocking Paolo) Blah blah blah, blah blah blah... blah blaaaaaah....  Wha-What did he say that was so funny?  That's... that's classic.	1
  Okay, all right.  Fan out! Fan out!  (jumping in triumph) OH YES!!!!!  Yeah, well, I couldn't find any cards, so it was either this or Strip Bag Of Old Knitting Stuff.  All right, relax. It's just a shoe.  Fine. Gang up on me! I got you all right where I want you.  Actually, y'know it's kinda cold, so how about I keep my boxers on, and give you all a peek at the good stuff?	1
  ...And so then I realised. All this stuff I had been doing. proposing to Joshua, lying to Ross about why I couldn't come to the wedding. Was all just a way of...  Ehh, pardon me?  But he has to know how I feel!	1
  Pheebs, he seems to enjoy it.  Well, have-have you told him how you feel?	0
  That's me.  Actually, uh, we're both the father. (Puts his arm around Joey)  Please tell me you know which one is our baby.  Ok.  Yeah?  Hey, Ben, remember us? Ok, the mole came off.  What're we gonna do? What're we gonna do?  Oh, we're gonna flip for the baby?  All right, call it in the air.	0
  Excuse me. Hi.  Well, your kind of sitting in my seat.	1
  Who's Chip?  The guy who took Rachel to the prom? Why is he calling you?  Monica, you're so lucky! He's like the most popular guy in school!!  (to Rachel) I was just leaving.  Why? Did you write it?  Well ah, actually...	1
  No, Stephen Hurs was the kid who would eat anything for money, David Stein was the guy who had no elbows.  OK that's not what he was doing. Alright, he was looking for his bus money. [a voice in the background calls for makeup]  Oh uh, o, OK.  Well, uh, let's try one more. . . there you go, say Ernie's, 8 o'clock.  No one was around to hear that? [back to Rachel and Monica]	1
  Alright, alright, but you better be wearing clothes when I open my eyes.  Sweet mother of all that is good and pure.  Congratulations!  So uh, which one is mine?	0
  (as Rachel) (Suddenly laughing) Oh, god, I am so spoiled... That's it!  (as Rachel) I used to wet my bed.	0
  What are you talking about?  What?	1
  I- I think they're great! I, I really do.  (To Ross) Do you remember the Ludwins? The big one had a thing for you, didn't she?  Aw, Mom...	0
  Yeah baby!	0
  Marcel?  Marcel?  Um, we're kind of having an emergency and we-we were looking for something...  Yes have you seen any?	1
  Why don't you go up there and ask him to 'step lightly, please?'  Ooh, that is silly. (gets up) I'll go up there, I'll tell him to keep it down.	1
  Hey guys!  All right, here's the ring. (Shows Chandler the wedding ring he plans on giving Emily)  So uh, any ideas for the bachelor party yet?  I sort've already asked Chandler.  Joey, I figured you'd understand. I mean, I-I've known him a lot longer.  (to Chandler) Wait-wait, so, you get to be my best man twice and I never get to be yours at all?	1
  (answering her phone at work) Hello.  Oh, hi.  Well, there was a disaster in shipping and I've got to get this order in. Honey, I'm so sorry, but it looks like I'm gonna be here all night.	0
  No, I know, I know, that this is Frank's life, (walks behind them, they turn around in the leather chairs to face her) y'know. Y'know, I don't want to be all judgmental, y'know, but this is sick, it's sick and wrong!  No-no, oh, I'm fine with the age thing y'know, until it starts sticking it's tongue down my little brother's throat!  But, I mean, do you think he's gonna enjoy it when he's up to his elbows in the diapers from all the babies they have to have right away?! This is not fair to Frank, (she walks behind them again, and hey again turn to follow her) and it-it's not fair to the babies, and y'know what, it's not good home economics.  Yes. Not out loud.  Yeah, but if I do tell him, then he's gonna hate myself. I mean look at him and his Mom, I can't. (pause) But, you guys can, please you gotta talk him out of it.	1
"  I don't know, I could maybe go out for a couple of beers, but there's this thing about bumblebees on The Discovery Channel that I was planning to watch.  Nooo!! Gandolf?! Gandolf is coming to town?  Dude, we are sooo gonna party!  Mike ""Gandolf"" Ganderson, only like the funest guy in the world.  I'm gonna call after you!"	0
  Uh, so, uh, Rach, uh... do you wanna save this wrapping paper, I mean, it's only a little bit torn... so are you gonna go for it with Ross or should I just throw it out?  Oh my God, me too! Oh! Oh, we'd be like friends-in-law! Y'know what the best part is? The best part is that you already know everything about him! I mean, it's like starting on the fifteenth date!  Another good point.  Why isn't it working out?  Is he not cute enough for you?  Does he not make enough money?	1
  [sullenly] Hiiiiii.  Yeah, yeah, just a tough day at work. A stegosaurus fell over and trapped a kid. Whoa, whoa, I know this jacket, this is, th--Fun Bobby's jacket! Where is he, what. He, he's here, isn't he?  Don't toy with me. [Fun Bobby (FBOB) enters from Monica's bedroom.]  Hey, Fun Bobby!  Not at all! I love this guy. Hey, I was so psyched to hear you're back with my sister!	0
  Chandler is fantastic!!  Oh God, we just clicked! Y'know how people just click? Like he came by to pick me up, and I opened the door, and it was just like, click! Did he tell you?	1
"  (entering) Hey!!  Guess what. Frank Jr., and Alice got married!  And! And, they're gonna have a baby! (The gang is shocked.) And! And, they want me to grow it for them in my uterus. (The gang is stunned into silence.)  Yeah  Ewww! And ""Oh no!"" It's-they just want me to be the surrogate. It's her-it's her egg and her sperm, and I'm-I'm just the oven, it's totally their bun.  Well, they said that I had to think about it first, but what is there to think about? I'm gonna be giving them the greatest gift you can possibly give.  I know!  Yeah, what's your point?  Y'know you guys were a lot more supportive when I wanted to make denim furniture."	0
  Well at least, I'm going to mute it.  Hi!  Okay.	1
  Nothing.  In a month?  You mean, you mean 30 days?	1
  Oh yeah.  Yeah alright. [they sit at the couch]  Oh, sorry we didn't know.	0
  Oh no no no no, no no no no no no, you see, what I had planned shouldn't take more that 2, 3 minutes tops.	1
  Ah here, we brought wine.  So, Monica, how's the ankle?	1
  Look, here's what we'll do. We'll put all keys and watches in the hat over there. Alright. [they all put their keys and watches in the hat and put it on a mail box] Alright, c'mon man, let's do this. [they all jump in the street and prepare to fight]  Actually, you know, uh, I gotta show this apartment tomorrow and uh, you know, this no faces thing might not be a bad idea.  Oh really, you guys tryin' again?	0
  [enters] Check it out man, I tore it off some mannaquin in the alley behind Macy's.  So I got it in the junior miss department, big diff. Anyway check it out man, it's gonna make a hell of a conversation piece at out next cocktail party, huh pal?  Yeah, you know, put chips in it, we'll make like a chip chick.  Uh yes, I think I vaguely recall it.  Uh, yes.  We took a road trip to Las Vegas man.	0
  Oh, could somebody give me a hand with this zipper?  Up!  Yeah, I did. I needed my lucky dress.  Ohh, God! Look at him, he's so cute. I wanna go over there, grab him, and kiss him! How can I kiss him and not letting him know that I like him?  What?	1
  Okay.  Oh! Ooh! Umm!  Hey, why don't you?  Uh-huh, yeah!  No, I'm really okay with this. Y'know why? 'Cause look at them, and I made that, so... I know it's gonna be like a million times harder to give up a baby but, oh my God, it's gonna feel like a million times better, right? I wanna do this. (To Frank and Alice) I wanna carry your baby.	0
  And may-maybe we could end up on a boat again?	1
  Well, thanks again for lunch.  It was, wasn't it?  Wasn't it?  You too.  Great! I'm looking forward to it. Rachel, any messages?	1
  Yeah, well you promised Barry, you'd marry him. (Rachel glares at her, and she retreats to safety between Richard's legs)  Woo-hoo, stuud!  Woo-hoo, geeek!  Please!	1
  Oh, shoot, we gotta go, got a reservation in 30 minutes.  Oh, 200 seconds of passion. We gotta go.  But um, here's an idea, have you ever worn women's underwear?	1
  Hello, Chandler.  Margha.  Mar-gha.	1
  (looking fearfully at Joey) Hey, he's not crying. (Ben starts crying)  You, you are gonna love this.  Stay back, I've got kiwi. Run, Joey, Run!	0
  (entering from bedroom) Okay, I'll be back in just a minute. Oh, Phoebe I'm sorry that I left lipstick marks on the phone.  Oh, then it must've been you. Bye. (leaves)	0
  What do you got there?  How come the writing is in Spanish?	0
  Gunther, Gunther, please, I've worked here for two and a half years, I know the empty trays go over there. (points to the counter.)	1
  ...and then Zana, just let one rip!! (laughs histerically)  You know where I work!	1
  Calm down, we got time, we're running a little late.  Yeah, we loves 'em. I've never seen him with-(He gets a whiff of Joey and starts smelling around.)  You.  You?  What?	1
  Me neither, y'know what-  What are you mad at me for?!	1
  I don't know, Chandler. Let's take a look.  Why, it's dinner for six. 5 steaks, and an eggplant for Phoebe.  Yeah, we switched meat suppliers at work, and the new guys gave me the steaks as sort of a thank-you.  It's on us, all right, so don't worry. It's our treat.  Like?  Charity?	1
  (entering, wearing a white suit with a little red bow tie) Hey, you guys! Guess what?  Y'know what I didn't wear this suit for a year because you hated it. Well, guess what? You're not my girlfriend anymore so...  Right.  (to Monica) You like it right?	0
  I'm also thinking about opening up my own restaurant.	0
  All right, all right, if you insist on doing this, at least let me help you.  No. That's not what I'm saying. I just may know a few things that might help you inflict some pain.  Yeah? Listen closely, Devon has got a weak ankle.  One swift kick and he'll back off.  And that big bloke with the beard, he has got a trick hip. Yeah. And uh, and David over there, I heard he doesn't wear a cup.	0
  Hang on buddy! (He goes over and unlocks the door and opens it to reveal a fully furnished apartment.)  I sure did.  Well, I just thought it'd make me feel good to do something nice for my friend.  Oh no-no-no. This is amazing. (He goes over and presses a button on a remote control that opens the entertainment center doors revealing the TV.)  Well, y'know I'm 29. I mean who needs a savings account.  Oh, I don't know.  You mean with Casey.  Or Casey.	0
  Hey, Mon, if you were hoping to sleep with Joshua the first time tonight, which one of these would you want to be wearing. (She's holding two frilly, lace nighties.)  Sorry. I'm so exited! I've been waiting for this for months! I got my hair coloured! I got new sheets! I'm making him a very fancy meal.	0
  Hey, honey! What's the matter? (Monica shows her, her hat.) Fine, I was just trying to be nice! Whoa!  Well, wait a minute, you're the boss! Why don't you just yell at them? Or, fire them?	1
  Wow! There's a lot I didn't know about vomit. (The duck comes to the door of the bathroom, quacking.) (To the duck) In a minute. (The duck goes back into the bathroom.)  Twelve hundred dollars? You think I have $1200? I'm home in the middle of the day, and I got patio furniture in my living room. I guess there's a few things you don't get from book learnin'.  How about zero down and zero a month for a long, long time?	0
  Hey!  Nice uh, costume.	0
  Please. This is so your fault.  Look, Carol never threw me out of a room before you came along.  You tryin' to be clever? A funny lady?  Oh, I'm threatened by you?	1
  I'm telling you, she went to the airport, and she's gonna go for it with Ross!  Guys, you got your hair cut.	0
  W-wait. What is that?  No, no, I don't.	1
  I think it's great. Y'know, it's sweet, it's romantic...  No, you kidding? The guy's a freak.. (Ross enters off camera)  Oh, I thought you were great in Silence of the Lambs. Oh come on, admit it! All things considered, you had fun tonight.  You gotta do it, man.	1
  (To a woman who he has clearly just met) And then the peacock bit me. (Laughs) Please kiss me at midnight. (She leaves)  Ooh. Uh, I don't know how to tell you this, but she's in Monica's bedroom, getting it on with Max, that scientist geek. Ooh, look at that, I did know how to tell you.  And the moment of joy is upon us.  Y'know, I uh.. just thought I'd throw this out here. I'm no math whiz, but I do believe there are three girls and three guys right here. (Makes kiss noise)	0
  (rushing up) Hey-Hey-Hey! Who was that?  Goin' out, huh? Wow! Wow! (Does a little celebration dance) So things didn't work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer.  (shocked) What?  Wait! You're going out with Kathy!  Well, I'm upset-for you. I mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you. (He can't believe he just sad that.)	1
  Ooo, a crossword! Can I help?  Fine. But you can't help me develop my new universal language.  Mon! I'm so happy for you!	0
  It just doesn't...feel like we're breaking up.  Okay.  Thanks.  Okay. (Starts to button up his shirt)  I'm getting dressed.  When I walk outside naked people throw garbage at me.  What is it?  Ah-ha, you're not the boss of me. (She kisses him) Yeah, you are! (She handcuffs him to the chair) Ooh, saucy.  You are, you're gonna leave me like this?  Okay. But if you don't come back soon, (She leaves and closes the door) there's pretty much nothing I can do about it!	0
  Yeah, what' going on?  Awwww!	0
  Hey, mate.  Do you realise that we have not seen each other since the night of that U2 concert?  We were playing rugby.	0
  Hey.  Ok, Love Story, Brian's Song, and Terms of Endearment.  Yeah, I talked to my grandma about the Old Yeller incident, and she told me that my mom used to not show us the ends of sad movies to shield us from the pain and sadness. You know, before she killed herself. [Chandler and Joey enter]	1
  Okay, relax, relax. We are gonna be here for a while, it looks like, and we still have boyfriends and your career to cover.  Oh! ...Yeah, they were gross. Oh, you know what I loved? Her Sweet 'n' Los. How she was always stealing them from- from restaurants.  Not just restaurants, from our house.  She looks so small.  Well, at least she's with Pop-Pop and Aunt Phyllis now.  Bye, Nana.  Y'know how-how the nurse said that-that Nana had passed? Well, she's not, quite..  She's not- past, she's present, she's back.  She may have died.	1
  Hi, I'm selling Brown Bird cookies.  No, hi, I'm, I'm an honorary Brown Bird (does the Brown Bird salute.)  Ah, well, it means that I can sell cookies, but I'm not invited to sleep-overs.	1
  Oh, hi, darling!  Oh, well we cut the trip short.  Oh, say no more!	1
  (seeing Ross and Bonnie inside Central Perk) Oh my God! Phoebe look, it's Ross and that girl.  Phoebe! (goes back to the window)  Come on Phoebe, look at that! They are not breaking up, look at them. Okay that's, you know what that is? That is a, that is a second date, that's what that is! Look at that, she just put her hand on his thigh...  Ohh! (walking away from the window) Phoebe, this is all your fault! Now he loves her, he's gonna marry her, and this is all your fault.  You said she was bald!!  Phoebe, we can't, we just can't just let it happen! Okay, we have to do something! We have to break them up! Okay? Just go in there and like, shave her head! You owe me one bald girl!!  (quietly) Yes.  Yes.	1
  Esther Livingston. [scratches out name] Gone. [Phoebe enters.]  Hi, Phoe.  Oh, just updating the phonebook.  [nervously] Oh. Oh, sure, sure, uh, uh, how come?  Oh, sure, yeah. [gets a box with the pictures] This is the one of you father in a meadow, and, uh, helping a little boy fly a kite, and here he is at a graduation. . . another graduation. . . another graduation.  Is it really your fa--I can't... well of course it is.  Look, I. . .  Alright, that is not your father, that's just a picture of a guy in a frame.  It was your mother's idea. Ya know, she didn't want you to know your real father because it hurt her so much when he left, and, I didn't want to go along with it, but, well then she died and, and it was harder to argue with her. Not impossible, but harder.  Last I heard, he was a pharmacist somewhere upstate.	0
  No, forget it.  All right, fine. Um, you were not the only one there. (Camera fades to Ross, who's listening very carefully) Joey was there too.  No.  No, it was just the three of us.  (laughs) You know what?  There were times when it wasn't even me.  Mon, Ethan called again. Mon?  Ethan called again.  I, I didn't say any... I sw... I did not say anything, I swear. He stopped by.	1
  Ok, thanks for coming, I hope you guys had fun.  Ok will do. So glad you came.  Ok, let me go check. Your mom want's to say goodbye.	0
  (joining them) Hey guys.  So, anyone up for a midnight dip in the ocean?  Okay, I'll see you in a bit.	0
  Oh please, I saw the way you were checking out his mouldings. You want it.  Well it wouldn't kill you to say it once in a while.  What?  Woah, woah, woah. I don't need a roommate either, OK? I can afford to live here by myself. Ya know, I may have to bring in somebody once a week to lick the silverware.  Look, you know what? If this is the way you feel, then maybe you should take it.	1
  Hey hey hey! She's on!  Your mom was arrested?	1
  Hey Duck, is Chick here?  Yeah, but y'know, I think the reason we're not getting that spin right is because my apartment's too small.  No, I ahh, had another idea.  I know, we did it!! Hey, that was incredible, huh?!  Thank you, listen, thanks a lot Tribbiani, (checks watch). Oh my God, look at the time, I gotta catch the bus to the ball.  Yeah.  Ahh, thanks but no. You see I-I think I'm ready to dance with girls.  Yeah.	0
  (trying to bite into an apple) Ow! Ow! (drops the apple in disgust.)  All right, fine, fine, but if you're my next victim, don't come back as a poltergeist and like suck me into the TV set.  Although, don't feel like you can't visit.	0
  All right, well I'm gonna put my sweats back on.  Yeah?  Stripping!  Okay, look, I'm gonna have to ask you all to leave.  Look, forget it. We tried, but Phase Three is a lost cause, Okay? Those strippers were insanely hot, and I couldn't picture myself with any of them. (Sits back in disgust.)	1
  Okay, okay, what's going on?  Yeah, well, does he look upset? Does he look like he was just told to shove anything?  What? What? What?!	0
  Huh.  I know.	1
  Hey, hey.  Yes, I am. As of today, I am officially Joey Tribbiani, actor slash model.  You know those posters for the city free clinic?  No, but I hear lyme disease is open, so... (crosses fingers)  Thanks.  Yeah.	1
  Yeah.  Yeah.	0
  Let me see that. (Monica shows her) Oh, yeah.  Well, y'know, sometimes that helps. (She realises what that could've meant.)	0
  So uhh, how's the palace?  Oh, uhh, actually I uh, have some news.  Well, uh, why don't you ask him yourself. Joey, this is my new roommate Eddie.  Well you know, we got to talking and uh, he said he needed a place and I had a spare room.	0
  Ohhh, I wanna come over there and give you a hug and wish you luck on your wedding, but I don't-can't get up.  Great! Yeah, could you bring me the newspaper?  Oh, have a great wedding!  Oh, hey, Chandler I wanna hug you too!  Oh, and great! You might as well bring me my book, it's on the counter in your apartment.	0
  But, we pick again! We pick again!	1
  Oh, hey.  Yeah, I'm sorry man.	0
  What, you don't think I know that?  Okay, but isn't sex better when it's with one person that you really, really care about.  You don't have it anymore?  Okay, so wait, all right, so how does that make things better?  Okay, so what you used to have with Rachel, is what I've got with Alice.  It's so cool man, it's so, it's just 'cause being with her is so much better than like not being with her.  You can have it!	1
  But, but this is my gig. This is where I play. My, my name is written out there in chalk. You know, you can't just erase chalk.  And he's going to be paying this woman? Why doesn't he just give her like a throne, and a crown, and like a, you know, gold stick with a ball on top.  Yeah, ok. You probably did everything you could.	1
  Rachel?  I don't know if you heard about what happened between me and Phoebe the other day_	1
  Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God. You are not gonna believe this. I have just been discovered.  Anyway, OK, now promise you won't like, freak out and say how great this is until I'm done, OK.  OK. I just met this producer of this like, teeny record company, who said that I have a very fresh, offbeat sound and she wants to do a demo of Smelly Cat.  I told you not to do that yet. And, she wants to do a video.  I'm not done yet, OK. God. OK, if that goes well, they may even want to make an album. [everyone is quiet, unsure if she's done or not]  I'm done now.	0
  I made a bet with myself that you have beautiful eyes. Now that I see them, I win.	1
  Hello-dillillio!!  (to Monica) Take off your shirt!  Yeah, Jell-o just like Mom used to make.	0
  Ohh.  Mom, there are so many people in my life. Some of them are seeing people and some of them aren't. Is that crystal?	1
  I really can't say.  I can't say.  I'm sorry, but I can't say.  I better get out of here, I'm gonna miss my flight.  Pleasure.  Take care. [Phoebe and Ryan walk outside.]	1
  We're notwe're not saying anything.  (to the girls) We were playing poker, alright...  And then he did.  There just don't happen to be any women in our games.	1
  You kids ready?  All right.  Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, I think I forgot my receipt.  Why not?  (gets his receipt and notices the twenty) What is this? Who put a twenty down here? Huh?	1
  He- he pooped in my shoe.  Those cute little black ones I wear all the time.	1
  That is amazing.  If can invade Poland, there isn't anything I can't do.	0
"  So Pheebs, do they know about each other?  Hey.  (going over to him) Well?!  Well what is it?!  Oh! Maybe they'll name yours after you! Y'know, they'll call it, The Ross. And then people would be like, ""Awww, he's got a Ross."""	0
  How'd the callback go?  Good for you.	0
  C'mon in.  Yeah! It's fine, it's fine. Robbie's gonna be here for hours.  So, how ya doin?	0
  [peeks back out] Ok, now that your coat is safely in the bedr-, [sees that the coast is clear] oh, ok we can come back out in the living room.	0
  Hey. Ross, did you know Mom and Dad are going to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving?  Yes, they are. The Blymens invited them.  I am not wrong.  No, I just talked to them.	1
  Come on, let's go!  Yeah, losers talk!  Yeah!	1
"  Oh! I knew it! I knew it! I felt really thick this morning.  Embryossss? As in, ""More than one?""  Five? Okay, where am I giving birth, a hospital or a big box under the stairs?  That's it! 25 percent? That means that's it's like 75 percent chance of no baby at all!  Okay, well y'know what, don't worry you guys, 'cause I'm-I'm gonna do this as many times as it takes to get it right."	0
  Actually, me too.  Oh damn, I hate that.	1
  Oh, but the party's only just getting started!  So why did you plan a party at the same time?  But Ross, I'm such having a great time! Your sister has just been telling me that you used to dress up like little, old ladies and hold make-believe tea parties.	0
  Yeah!	0
  All right now remember, something this big and long is going to be difficult to manuver, fortunately I have a lot of experience in that area.  All right, ladies and gentlemen, let's poke. (they start to advance the giant poking device) Steady. Steady. Okay, a little higher. Careful of the angle. Okay, okay, we're approaching the window (as he says this the camera cuts to their view of Ugly Naked Guy, so that we actually see him!) Thread the needle. Thread the needle.	1
  Oh sure, Cilantro Larry.  How could you say yes, what about our catering business?  Oh, in that case-(hops up and down in joy)-Yay! (Monica looks confused) That was me hopping on board.	1
  Rachel, there's nothing in it.  OK, here you go. Good luck.	0
  Oh my God! Thank you! Thank you so much! (He grabs the ring, kisses it, and then does a double-take realising where it's been.)  No, that's all right.	0
  [entering] There she is.  Sweetie! So this is where you work? Oh, it's wonderful! Is it a living room? Is it a restaurant? Who can tell? But I guess that's the fun.  Monica! You look gorgeous! Last time I saw you, it was eat or be eaten.  Oh hello, Ross.  So, what do you think of my daughter in the apron with the big job?  If you didn't pour the coffee, no one would have anything to drink.  This is just so exciting. You know, I never worked. I went straight from my father's house to the sorority house to my husband's house. I am just so proud of you.	0
  Well, you were pretty damn good.	0
  Is-is-is that message old or new? (yelling) Old or new?! Old or new?!  What if it's new? I mean, we agreed not to talk again, unless we had something really important to say. Shouldn't I call him back?  Huh?	1
  Hey.  Oh, there's banana on it.  So then you know? (Phoebe nods her head)  Oh, good. Thanks.  Okay, all right don't judge me to much. Okay? Um, but I saw this info-mercial, and um, I swear to you I have never-ever bought anything on TV before, except for this mop. But there was this stuff on leg waxing, it just, it looked so amazing....  Yes! Have you seen it?	0
  (entering) Everbody this is Frank! This is my half-brother Frank.  This is everybody. This is Ross.  Chandler.  Joey.  This is Monica.  And this is Rachel.  I'm gonna get coffee.	1
  [to Ross on the stairs] I have a wonderful idea. You should take Rachel to the prom.  Jack, give me that. Talk to your son.	1
  (entering) Hey! (Goes to the fridge.)	1
  Okay, (reading the card) Fonzy gives you two thumbs up, collect two cool points. Yeah.  Okay, come on! (blows on the dice) Daddy needs a new pair of electromagnetic microscopes for the Prehistoric Forensics Department! (They all look at him, and he shuts up and rolls the dice.) (he moves his piece) Okay. (reading a card) Take Pinky Tuscadero up to Inspiration Point, collect three cool points!! Yeah! Which gives me five, and let's see who is gonna lose their clothes. Ummmm, I think I pick our strip poker sponsor Mr. Joey Tribianni.	0
  Whoa, hey! What are doing? Trying to get me drunk?  Okay.	1
  Well now you have two. Hey, I am good at math.  Hey! Well, I've been preparing for that my entire life! Or something about you that's mean!	1
  (holding Ben) Look Benny, spoon. (moves it back and forth) Spoon. Come on! All right, y'know what I think he's bored.  Okay. Okay honey, he's fine, he's fine, let's just put him down. Come here, Ben. (sets him on the couch) See that's a good boy. (to Monica) How could you do that to him!! Ross trusted me, what is he going to say?!  We're not?!  All right, I like that.  So we're okay, we're okay, we're okay, (starts to exam Ben) aren't we? No, we're not okay, we're not okay, there's a bump, there's a bump.  I cannot push it in!  Okay, okay, okay.  Okay.  Or. We could put a hat on his head.  We need a hat..  Oh, oh, oh, I'll get 'Rainy Day Bear'!! (runs to get him)	1
  (entering) Hey guys!  I just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party! And the guys from work had a blast. Y'know, one of them had never been to a bachelor party before. Yeah! And-and another one had never been to a party before, so...  Yeah, right!  That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her.  Oh absolutely! It has been in my family for generations, and every bride who has worn it has had a long and happy life.  My-my ring? My-my wedding ring? The-the stripper stole my wedding ring?! H-how?! How could this all happen?!  (dialling the phone) All right-all right, fine! I-I'm gonna call the cops!  Not on you! On the stripper!  Okay, well, we'll call the company that sent her!	0
  Hey guys, does anybody know a good date place in the neighborhood?  OK, ahem, hey, does anybody know a good place if you're not dating a puma?  Her name is Celia. She's not a bug lady. She's curator of insects at the museum.	1
  Oh, my god, I am so glad you called me. I had the most supremely awful day.  We got the proofs back from that photo shoot, you know, the one with the little vegetables. Anyway, they pretty much sucked, so, I blew off the rest of the day, and I went shopping...(looks through her bags)... and I got you, I'm looking, I'm looking, I'm looking, I got you...  What?  I got you...these. (pulls out a pair of socks)  Well, I knew you had the Rockys, and so I figured, you know, you can wear Bullwinkle and Bullwinkle, or you can wear Rocky and Rocky,or, you can mix and match, moose and squirrel. Whatever you want.	0
  Uh, you left out the stupid part.  I think it's totally insane, I mean, they work for the hospital. It's like returning to the scene of the crime. You know, I say we blow off the dates.	1
  One ticket to Yemen?  I'm sorry sir, I don't understand.	1
  (Entering from her bedroom, talking on the phone) Yeah, once again, I am sorry. Thank you. Bye. (To the gang) I just had to turn down a job catering a funeral for sixty people.  Sixty guests.  Because I don't have the money or the equipment to handle something that big on such short notice. I mean there's no way.  I don't know.  Really? Cause I'd need like $500 for all the food and the supplies and stuff.  Well, you're not working either.  Yeah, that'd be great! Thank you!	1
  Wow! And you got a petticure. Your feet are all dressed up.  You're gonna do some feet flirtin'!	0
  (to Phoebe) Here you go. You can wear this. (hands her a sweater)  Uh-huh.  Phoebe?  All right. Honey, that's-that's a sleeve. Okay?  And! We also have speaker phone. (She turns on the speaker phone.)  Okay, wait, you gotta hang up 'cause we're gonna be late.	1
